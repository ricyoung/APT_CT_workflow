Specifically, anodal tDCS applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with improvement of cognitive functions and mood. Despite an increased use in clinical settings, tDCS suffers from limitations, especially regarding the strength and the duration of therapeutic effects. Strategies to optimize the conditions for tDCS application suffer from the lack of knowledge about its neurophysiological impact. Moreover, tDCS is increasingly used in private settings through commercial apparatus and tutorials to make a ""do-it-yourself"" device delivering tDCS now available on the Internet. This private use worries neuroscientists and health authorities. Even if the general impression is that, in controlled conditions, tDCS is safe with only mild and transient adverse effects, whether and how tDCS could be used for enhancing cognition in healthy subjects are needed to investigate in more detail. The investigators believe that a better understanding of some neurobiological effects of tDCS is crucial to further tailor tDCS for experimental and therapeutic applications and to define recommendations for a private use.||As the cortex is densely connected with basal ganglia areas, including dopaminergic areas, tDCS is probably not only capable to target cortical but also subcortical structures remote from the stimulation sites. Some studies suggest that cortical stimulation by other approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to an increased dopaminergic transmission. The involvement of dopaminergic systems in tDCS effects has been investigated only indirectly in pharmacological studies. Thus, the direct effect of the DLPFC stimulation by tDCS on dopaminergic transmission is still unknown.||The aim of this project is to reveal the online impact of a single-session of tDCS applied bilaterally over the DLPFC in healthy subjects on the dopaminergic transmission measured by PET, combined with the [11C]raclopride bolus-plus-continuous-infusion method.",,,,Measure of the Binding Ratio defined as the ratio of : region of interest / cerebellum activities),,36,Actual,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Non smoker|No pyschotrope consumption|No medical treatment|No psychiatric or somatic (neurological, endocrine, cardiac, renal)|Affiliated to the french social security||Exclusion Criteria:||No consent|For females : Pregnant or without birth control|Contraindications to stimulation by tDCS or to an MRI exam|Being in an exclusion period or over the annual compensation ceiling|Participation in another study using ionizing radiation in less than a year",,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,Bron Cedex,France,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02402101"", ""NCT02402101"")"

Despite the profound advances in neuroscience over the past 20 years, the investigators still largely use opiate narcotics, much as was done in the Civil War. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed 1. While knee pain is often a complaint that precedes TKA, the procedure itself is associated with considerable post-operative pain lasting days to weeks. Adequate postoperative pain control is an important factor in determining recovery time and hospital length of stay. New analgesic strategies are needed that can be used adjunctively to existing strategies with the potential to reduce reliance on opioid analgesia. Several novel brain stimulation technologies including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are beginning to demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety of pain conditions. Electricity has no metabolite or other residue, and can be delivered with minimal discomfort and without problems associated with drug-drug interactions. In two independent preliminary pilot studies, the Investigators have shown that tDCS can reduce post-operative PCA use by as much as 46% while simultaneously reducing subjective pain ratings.

The SST requires participants to respond to a target stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing a button, but also to withhold their response when they hear an auditory signal.

This syndrome affects between 3-5% of the population in an age group 40-60 years also occurring in childhood and old age. Reaches 3.4% of women and 0.5% of men. Fibromyalgia is a chronic widespread pain syndrome in various parts of the body. The neuromodulation techniques have as a principle produce inhibition or cortical arousal. The tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method used to modulate the cortical excitability, using a low intensity direct current (1-2mA) directed to the scalp via the cathode and anode electrodes. The current reaches the cortex, producing hyperpolarization or depolarization of the axonal membrane potential. Evidence has shown that this method is presented as a technique able to alter cortical and subcortical neural networks. This technique has been used to treat psychiatric disorders such as depression, acute mania, bipolar affective disorder, panic, hallucinations, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, withdrawal, rehabilitation after stroke, pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, migraine, pancreatitis pain chronic and fibromyalgia. The tDCS is a low cost technique, with virtually no side effects and which exerts therapeutic effect by neuromodulatory pathways by distinct pathways activated by the drugs. In this scenario falls within the importance of developing this device for home use by fibromyalgia patients, since it is easy to use and thereby enables maintaining the benefit observed in studies performed and supervised frequently used in care centers. The use of tDCS over the long term is not feasible in hospital by patients demands, sometimes every day or more than once a week, removing the patient from their activities, and cost shifting and overload the healthcare system.

Specifically, fronto-temporal tDCS, with anodal stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathodal stimulation over the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), has been reported to reduce treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations (AH), negative symptoms and insight of the illness in schizophrenia. However, despite an increasing use in clinical settings, tDCS suffers from limitations, especially regarding the strength and the duration of therapeutic effects.||Some imaging reports suggest that tDCS effects are not restricted to the brain areas located under the electrodes, but spread through distributed cortical networks functionally connected with the targets and reach subcortical areas. Overall, these studies suggest that tDCS modulates functional connectivity within and across resting-state networks and brain activity. However, these effects are currently described at different levels depending on the imaging technique used. Moreover, the majority of studies have focused on motor cortex stimulation, while the specific effects of fronto-temporal tDCS are scarce. Finally, effects of the stimulation applied online are rarely inspected.||According to the therapeutic effects of fronto-temporal tDCS on schizophrenia and the dopaminergic pathophysiological hypothesis of schizophrenia, the effect of fronto-temporal tDCS on dopaminergic transmission is of major interest. As the cortex is densely connected with basal ganglia areas, tDCS effects are probably capable to reach subcortical dopaminergic areas. Indeed, recent fMRI studies highlighted subcortical effects of tDCS applied at the cortical level including modulations of cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. In addition, some studies suggest that cortical stimulation by other approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates dopaminergic transmission. However, tDCS effects on dopaminergic transmission have been investigated only indirectly.||Finally, information about biological effects of tDCS is scattered and creating a coherent ensemble is a mandatory and critical step to understand the mechanisms of action of tDCS.||According to the hypothesis that fronto-temporal tDCS modulates brain activity, connectivity and dopaminergic transmission, the aim of this project is to reveal the combined neurobiological impact of an online single session of fronto-temporal tDCS in a unique experiment by developing a simultaneous multimodal imaging approach (PET-MRI). The online implementation of the stimulation will allow deciphering changes induced during and after stimulation. As a first step before investigating patients with schizophrenia, healthy subjects will be involved in the present study.||The distributed changes will be explored at rest through:||Spontaneous functional connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI).|Brain activity assessed by cerebral blood flow quantitatively and directly measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL).|Connectivity assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).|Specific and localized dopaminergic transmission evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) using dopaminergic D2 subtype receptor availability via [11C]raclopride binding.||The pioneering aspects of the project are to use an innovative simultaneous multimodal imaging system, adopt the tDCS montage used in our validated therapeutic context and apply tDCS online.

They are particularly appealing since many patients are either refractory or present side effects to standard pharmacological regimens. TDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation). a novel non- pharmacological brain stimulation technique, might help in overcoming some of these issues, since it has low cost, high portability and it is relatively easy to use. TDCS consists in applying a weak, direct current through two electrodes placed over the scalp; the anode and the cathode increasing and decreasing cortical excitability during and beyond the period of stimulation. It is also a safe technique with only mild adverse effects described. Previous studies, some of them from our group, have described that tDCS is an effective technique for major depression.

Electrical currents induced by tDCS electrodes produce an electrical field that modulates the excitability of brain areas. In the present HD-tDCS montage, one anodal electrode and four return electrodes are applied. Hereby, the anodal electrode modulates the excitability of the targeted area, whereas the other 4 electrodes return electrical currents that flow away from that area. Direct currents will be transmitted through 5 circular PiStim electrodes of 3.14cm2 (Neuroelectrics, Barcelona, Spain; current density=0.32 mA/cm2) with a current intensity of 1.5 mA. The HD-tDCS session will last for 20 minutes in total, with a 60 sec ramp at the beginning and end of the session. The electrodes will be filled with conductive gel and plugged into an EEG cap, with the anode placed over Fz and the four return electrodes over Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8 (10-20 system).|For the sham-condition, the placement of the electrodes was identical to active HD-tDCS stimulation with the anode placed over Fz and the four return electrodes over Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8 (10-20 system). The direct current, also transmitted through 5 circular PiStim electrodes of 3.14cm2 (Neuroelectrics, Barcelona, Spain; current density=0.32 mA/cm2), was increased in a ramp-like fashion over 60 seconds until it reached 1.5 mA. Directly after ramp-up, the current intensity was gradually switched off over 60 seconds, followed by 20 minutes without active stimulation. Sham procedures for tDCS mimic the transient skin sensation at the beginning of active HD-tDCS, without producing any conditioning effects on the brain. Consequently, participants are reliably blinded for sham tDCS.",Not Applicable,2020-02-18,2021-05-13,2020-01-15,Completed,"Psychological disorders characterized by impulsivity often show alterations in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity. Recent research has therefore focused on non-invasive neurostimulation therapies for the modulation of functional activity in the dACC. To date there has only been one proof-of-concept study providing evidence for modulating dACC activity with non-invasive electrical neurostimulation (e.g. transcranial electrical stimulation). Since transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is relatively safe, tolerable, and mobile as compared to other neurostimulation techniques, it is worthwhile looking further into the effects of tDCS on functional dACC activity. The aim of the present research is to explore whether HD-tDCS can induce changes in the dACC in individuals with high trait impulsivity (N=20) in a double-blind cross-over study. Functional changes in dACC activity will be measured by the error related negativity (ERN), which is an event related potential generated by the dACC. The ERN is less pronounced in people that score high on impulsivity. It is therefore expect enhanced ERN amplitudes after HD-tDCS over the dACC. In addition, performance on the multisource interference task will be used as measure of dACC activity. It is hypothesize that increased dACC activity will be related to decreased impulsivity in high impulsive individuals as shown by improved inhibitory control on the Go/NoGo task.

In patients with chronic pain, the anode is commonly placed over the motor cortex (M1) (Valeriani et al., 1999).",Not Applicable,2015-09-04,2017-05-01,2016-11-01,Completed,"Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of vulvodynia and despite its high prevalence and important sexual, conjugal and psychological deleterious repercussions, effective evidence-based interventions remain limited. For a high proportion of women, significant pain persists despite the currently available treatments. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) was shown to be effective in various chronic pain conditions. So far, only one case report study has shown significant pain reduction in women with vulvodynia. The main goal of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS in women with PVD compared to sham tDCS. Forty women diagnosed with PVD, by a gynecologist following a standardized protocol will be randomized to either active or sham tDCS for ten 20 minute sessions of 2 mA stimulation over a 2-week period. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, after treatment and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome is pain during intercourse assessed with a numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary measurements focus on sexual function, vestibular pain sensitivity, psychological distress, treatment satisfaction and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). The investigators expect that active tDCS treatment will significantly reduce pain during intercourse (post-treatment and 3-month follow-up compared to pre-treatment assessment). This trial will provide important information for determining the efficacy of a novel and promising intervention for women with PVD.",,,Vulvodynia|Vulvar Vestibulitis,"Pain during intercourse will be assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain at all, and 10 is the worst pain ever. This method for measuring pain has been shown to detect significant treatment effects in women with PVD and demonstrates a significant positive correlation with other pain intensity measures. Pain during intercourse is the main symptom of PVD and the one that most interferes with quality of life, hence the most relevant measure of functional outcome (Bergeron et al., 2008; Bergeron et al., 2001; Morin et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2011).","The McGill-Melzack questionnaire allows the assessment of sensory, affective and evaluative components of pain. This world-renowned questionnaire, studied for its validity, reliability and responsiveness to change, is commonly used in RCTs (Bergeron et al., 2001; Melzack, 1975; Davidoff et al., 1987; Hays et al., 1994; Bansal et al., 2009; Moy et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2010).|A gradual pressure (1 to 1000 g) will be applied to three distinct points of the vestibule at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions (Cyr et al., 2014). Each of these pressure points will be applied randomly (e.g. 3,6,9 or 3,9,6 or 6,9,3.). During this procedure, each participant will be asked to indicate when they start to feel pain (pain threshold) and subsequently the maximal pressure that can be tolerated (pain tolerance). Pain intensity is assessed throughout the test using a Computerized Visual analog scale (CoVas). This assessment has shown good reliability and validity (Cyr et al., 2014).|The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a multidimensional measure of sexual function evaluating desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. In addition to good psychometric properties (reliability, internal consistency and responsiveness to change (Rosen et al., 2000; Goldfinger et al, 2009), normative data are available for this questionnaire suggesting clinical level of dysfunctions (Wiegel et al., 2005).|Pain catastrophizing will be assessed using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan, Bishop, & Pivik, 1995), which consists of 13 items measuring exaggerated negative thoughts and feelings about the meaning of pain. Items are scored on a 5-point scale with the end points (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS is a reliable and valid measure that has demonstrated a stable factorial structure across clinical and general populations, including a French population (French et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2000; Sullivan, et al., 1995).|Anxiety will be assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI - (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970); ASTA - (Gauthier & Bouchard, 1993)). The STAI is a 40-item, well-known and widely used measure of state and trait anxiety that has demonstrated very good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha State = .93, Trait = .97) in various clinical and non-clinical samples including pain populations (Gauthier & Bouchard, 1993; Greenberg & Burns, 2003; Rule & Traver, 1983; Tanaka-Masumi & Kameoka, 1986).|Depression or depression symptoms will be measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI-II is comprised of 21 items, with scores for most items ranging from 0 (low intensity) to 3 (high intensity) (Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996; Beck, Steer & Garvin, 1988). This measure of depression has been validated for use in chronic pain populations (Turner & Romano, 1984).|The Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-20), evaluating fear of pain, also shows good psychometric properties (Coons, Hadjistavropoulos & Asmundson, 2004; McCracken & Dhingra, 2002).|Patient self-reported improvement [scale of 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)] and treatment satisfaction [scale of 0 (worse) to 10 (complete cure)] will be measured at the 2-week post-treatment and 3-month post-treatment structured interview in order to assess the clinical significance of results.|Sexual satisfaction will be assessed using the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction scale, which consists of 5 items assessing global sexual satisfaction.

One promising tool that has been shown to improve this type of learning in healthy young individuals, is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

These modifiable behaviors account for a substantial proportion of deaths from cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and take a significant economic toll. Yet, many unhealthy behaviors are very resistant to change, despite widespread knowledge of the risks. Although theories of behavior change have been advanced to explain the persistence of these behaviors, few consider the neurobehavioral underpinnings. These approaches also fail to address a fundamental aspect of behavior change - an individual's ability to exert sufficient self-control to overcome temptations for immediate gratification and/or to maintain attention to long-term goals. With advances in the neuroimaging field, the investigators are learning where and how self-control over decisions and behaviors is executed in the brain. This work points to the central role of neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) in self-control processes that contribute to healthy choices. Further, emerging evidence shows that activity in the prefrontal cortices and cognitive control circuits can be modulated using a noninvasive and safe intervention: direct current transcranial stimulation (tDCS). The investigators pilot study, IRB study #820231, demonstrated that a single session of 1mA tDCS increased the ability to resist smoking in a validated smoking lapse paradigm.

Studies with animals has shown that anodal stimulation modulate the membrane in the way to depolarize which results in a long term potential in the stimulated area,Not Applicable,2014-05-24,2016-02-03,2015-10-01,Completed,"BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) have become part of the daily routine of all the health care professionals. Some studies have shown improvement in subjects with chronic pain using neuromodulation. Chronic pain is involved with neuronal excitability and the excitatory modulation is also being studied to treat chronic pain. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows the neuronal membranes to be neuromodulated. tDCS can enhance or inhibit the potential actions on the cortex. Studies with animals has shown that anodal stimulation modulate the membrane in the way to depolarize which results in a long term potential in the stimulated area.|PROBLEM: Most strategies for the treatment of TMDs are local and aim to treat directly the cranial-facial muscles, applying kinesitherapy on Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and/or on the jaws and on the occlusion of teeth. Some drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants, that act in the CNS are used in these patients with positive results in the beginning of the treatment. However, many patients after using these drugs in a daily basis, are refractory to them and do not present an improvement in the pain anymore or present several side-effects. Therefore, the investigators want to know if tDCS over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would have an analgesic effect when reaching emotional areas.|HYPOTHESIS: The investigators believe that neuromodulation by tDCS over DLPFC would decrease the anxiety level and consequently the muscular hyperactivity that is an important etiological factor of TMD. For that, the masseter motor evoked potential (MEP) will be used to verify any change.|AIM: To investigate if cathodal tDCS over right DLPFC has analgesic effects in subjects with muscular TMD.|METHOD: The investigators will run a three-arm crossover double blind with 15 muscular TMD subjects. The group treatments will be cathodal tDCS 1mA, cathodal tDCS 2mA and Placebo. To verify selection criteria the investigators will use RDC/TMD, Visual analogical scale (VAS) score from 4 to 10 for six months or longer, Inventory of state-trit anxiety (ISTA) score more than 42. The outcomes will be VAS, sensory testing, Electroencephalogram (EEG) and ISTA.",,,Craniomandibular Disorders,"The visual analogic scale allows us to convert subjective sensations as pain on numerical data. A 10cm scale where 0cm is no pain and 10cm the worse imaginable pain, will be used and the subjects will be asked to mark a point on the scale representing their pain. This instrument will be used by the subjects everyday during one week in a pain diary. A weekly response average will be calculated before the first interventions and after each one. Subjects will also fill a VAS before and after each tDCS session. The averages will be used to compare the VAS values before and after each intervention.","Another type of assessment is the electroencephalography, which measures the brain electrical current intensity using the analysis of waves. The alpha wave is related with relaxation and it is higher when the subject keeps her/his eyes closed, and lower when the eyes are open. The same can be seen in relaxation and alert states respectively. The EEG is a powerful tool to assess changes related to anxiety. The increase of alpha indicates reduction of chronic jitters (Hammond (2005).||In this study a 24 channels EEG will be used associated with TMS, both according the international system 10x20 of electrodes. We will check alpha amplitudes before and after tDCS stimulation to see if the alpha waves will increase/decrease. The reference electrodes will be placed in the left ear lobe and in the masseter assessed spot.

The patient will let the investigator know when he/she feels any pain and at that time, the procedure will be stopped and the value will be recorded. This procedure will be repeated 3 times. The test will take approximately 7-10 min to complete. To use the same tender point we will make a template over masseter area.|Mechanical perception and pain threshold: will be tested on the thenar area using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (0,008 a 300g/mm2).

When analyzing the trait we sought to evaluate the personality, auto image, the way one view a non-threatening situation as a true threat (Is that what you are trying to say?). State anxiety is the transitory emotional state, in response to environmental stimuli such as tachycardia, sweating, nausea and cramps.

Treatment is often challenging; an estimated 20-40% of patients do not benefit sufficiently from existing antidepressant interventions including trials of medication and psychotherapy. A 15-25% of patients manifest a chronic, treatment-resistant course of illness, resulting in a need for additional treatment options. Brain stimulation techniques are considered as a promising therapeutic approach in affective disorders like MDD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been largely investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed as novel treatment in MDD. In the largest 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial in MDD to date, Brunoni et al. (2013) have shown that tDCS combined with an Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) resulted in an antidepressant efficacy superior to placebo treatment, tDCS alone and sertraline alone.||The purpose of this study is to explore the sustained efficacy and tolerability of repeated tDCS for the treatment of MDD. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS in combination with an SSRI will provoke an antidepressant effect while antidepressant medication alone (sham tDCS) did not. This will be measured by the change from baseline in the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores after 6 weeks of treatment.||In this randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial (5 centers involved) patients with a diagnosis of MDD receive a 6-weeks treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode position F3, cathode over F4, 5 sessions/week for 4 weeks followed by 2 sessions/week for 2 weeks, 24 treatments in sum, 30min/day, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent stimulation), as adjunctive treatment with a SSRI.

Previous studies suggested that the activation of right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) should be involved in mental state reasoning in moral cognition. Implicit moral attitude, which reflects people's fundamental beliefs about right and wrong, could be assessed by implicit association test on moral scenarios (mIAT), as indicated by the D scores. According to our previous findings, we postulate that, during moral decision-making, the high D group would have less rTPJ involvement and the low D group would have more. Here we applied tDCS, a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, to modulate cortical excitability in rTPJ.||Based on our postulation, we divided participants into high D and low D group and hypothesized that tDCS over rTPJ would modulate the behavior depending on the group. The results revealed that, in aspect of mIAT, implicit moral attitude could be modulated differently depending on the group via tDCS over rTPJ.

The test was adapted from Implicit Association Test (IAT) developed by Greenwald and colleagues (1998).

In mIAT, target concepts were presented by morally good and morally bad clips, and attributes were presented by positive and negative words.|To verify the modulation of rTPJ activity via tDCS and to examine whether this modulation would alter people's moral behavior, participants would take the perspective of the active role while viewing moral scenarios in the MRI scanner.||Forty-five dynamic visual stimuli from previous research were validated and applied in the Moral Action Task.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that is capable of stimulating brain activity to facilitate learning. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pairing of two therapeutic techniques, cognitive remediation and tDCS, as a cognitively enhancing intervention. This study is designed to address four questions. Is cognitive remediation paired with tDCS more efficacious than cognitive remediation delivered with sham stimulation? Is it possible to predict responsiveness to the intervention? Is intervention-induced cognitive change sustainable? Are there barriers to implementing this intervention in clinical practice?||To examine the incremental benefit of pairing tDCS with cognitive remediation, a 110 clinically stable outpatients between the ages of 18-65 who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder will be enrolled in a double-blind, double-baseline, sham-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tDCS or sham stimulation concurrent with working memory focused cognitive remediation. Training will be offered to participants in a small group format. Training will consist of 48 sessions, with 2-3 sessions scheduled in a week. Each training session will last 2 hours. One hour will be spent completing cognitive exercises that require working memory skills on a computer. TDCS or sham stimulation will be offered concurrent with the first 20 minutes of training with a StarStim neuromodulator. One mA of anodal stimulation will be applied to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the cathodal electrode will be placed in the contralateral supraorbital position. Upon completion of working memory training, participants will transition to a 30-minute discussion group. The discussion will focus on application of cognitive skills in everyday life. Effective strategies for approaching cognitive tasks will be described and practiced. Participant experience with aspects of the training will be monitored with self-report measures of motivation, mood, and physical reactions. To assess intervention-induced change, working memory, other aspects of cognition, functional capacity, and community functioning will be assessed pre- and post-intervention. Cognitive outcomes will be assessed with training tasks as well as tasks that are unfamiliar to participants. A performance-based measure will be used to assess functional capacity for everyday living skills and a self-report instrument will be used to assess community functioning. Potential confounds such as symptom severity, medication changes, outside treatment hours, and significant life stressors will be assessed individually every 2 weeks during the intervention phase of the study. Sustainability of intervention-induced change will be assessed with assessment sessions 6 weeks post-intervention. Change in performance during the first 12 training sessions on two working memory training tasks, a n-back task and a complex span task, will be used to determine if early response to treatment is predictive of post-intervention outcomes. An intent-to-treat analysis will be used to analyze intervention-induced change. Regression analyses will be conducted to identify predictors of treatment response.||Achieving the proposed objectives will yield important information about the efficacy, durability, and efficiency of a novel pairing of cognitively enhancing interventions.

The electrical current is generally completely imperceptible after initial period of tingling which takes about 30 seconds. Stimulation under the anode appears to increase brain activity where as stimulation under the cathode has the opposite effect. This research plan involves two clinical trials:||A study using tDCS to treat both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as lack of motivation and energy appear to arise due to a lack of activity in frontal brain areas. Positive symptoms such as hallucinations and confused thoughts may arise through over activity of brain areas more on the side and towards the back of the brain called the temporal cortex. We plan to apply tDCS such that it can simultaneously increased activity in these frontal brain areas and reduce activity over temporal cortex. We will compare active stimulation to a placebo condition which involves turning the stimulator off after 30 seconds. The capacity to target multiple symptom clusters is unique with this type of brain stimulation.|The study using tDCS in treatment resistant depression builds on a work with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS techniques in depression seem to work which increased left frontal brain activity or decrease right frontal brain activity. tDCS will be used to do the same thing with the anode used to increase left-sided brain activity and the cathode used to simultaneously decreased right-sided brain activity.||tDCS is potentially a better tolerated procedure than TMS and does not appear to have the same risk of seizure induction.

During the treatment, two electrodes are positioned on the scalp above regions of the brain implicated in abnormal cortical activity associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Due to the directional flow of current, one electrode, termed ""cathodal"",inhibits cortical activity, and the other, termed ""anodal"", increases cortical activity. These electrodes will be placed such that cathodal stimulation is applied to an area associated with hyperactivity and anodal stimulation to an area associated with hypoactivity.

(5 times/week) for 2 consecutive weeks. Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) will be used to quantify the UE functional motor ability. Box and Block Test (BBT) will be used for gross manual dexterity and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) will be used to measure fine hand dexterity. All measurements will be taken pre-treatment (T0) and post-treatment (T1) immediately after the 10th session, then 4 weeks after the end of stimulation period (T2) to assess the long-term effects.||Expected results: This study would verify whether enhancing the motor cortical hyperexcitability in the contralesional hemisphere has a beneficial on recovery of the paretic hand, or regaining the balance of transcallosal inhibitory circuits between the motor areas in both hemispheres has more positive effects on the motor outcomes .

However, despite continued advances in ECT technique, neurocognitive dysfunction continues to be a frequent adverse effect. Declarative memory and less so selective memory are often impaired after an ECT course. Immediate memory, however, is broadly preserved. It is hypothesized that memory impairments are due to ECT induced disruptions on long term potentiation as well as in cerebral flux and glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. Different pharmacological agents for the treatment of ECT induced cognitive dysfunction have been tried. Agents such as opioids, vasopressin, neuropeptides, cholinergic agents, thyroid hormone, and stimulants have been used with equivocal results, and no controlled studies showed clear efficacy.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation treatment that uses direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain. Electrical currents are applied constantly at low intensities (1-2 mA) over a long period, usually in minutes (5-30 minutes), to achieve changes in cortical excitability by influencing spontaneous neural activity. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation acts to excite neuronal activity while cathodal stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity. Several studies demonstrated moderate to strong effect sizes of tDCS in various neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric settings. Majority of studies show positive effects of tDCS on cognitive functioning among healthy volunteers and subjects with neurological or psychiatric conditions. Beneficial effects of online stimulation applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have been reported for working memory, attention and information processing in depressed patients. To the investigators' knowledge no studies have evaluated the potential efficacy of tDCS for the prevention of ECT induced cognitive adverse effects.||In the current study, the investigators propose a double blind, randomized controlled trial to test the use of tDCS as a strategy to prevent or mitigate the memory impairments frequently associated with an ECT course.",No,No,Depressive Disorder,Change in memory function will be determined by a factor analysis of all memory tests,"Remission is defined as two consecutive Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores <= 10, and HRSD total score does not change > 3 points or remains < 6 at the last two consecutive ECT treatments.",32,Actual,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Subjects 18 years of age and above;|Diagnosis of Major Depression confirmed by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (SCID-IV) interview;|ECT is clinically indicated;|Patient is competent to provide informed consent;||Exclusion Criteria:||Lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or any other primary psychotic disorder as well as Bipolar Disorder, as defined in the DSM-IV;|Current diagnosis of delirium or any major or minor neurocognitive disorder;|Diagnosis of Mental Retardation;|Limited English proficiency;|Baseline Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score < 21 or a total score falling two standard deviations below the age- and education-adjusted mean, whichever is less;|Skin lesions at the site of electrodes and any documented head or neck dermatological disorder;|Person with any kind of neurostimulator, an electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implant (including cardiac pacemaker), an intracerebral vascular clip, or any other electrically sensitive support system;|Any active general medical condition or central nervous system (CNS) disease which can affect cognition or response to treatment;|A history of medication-resistant epilepsy in the family, and/or past history of seizures or unexplained spells of loss of consciousness during the previous 36 months|Current (within the past three months) diagnosis of active substance dependence, or active substance abuse within the past week, as determined by interview and chart review.|Active suicidal ideation, as measured by scores of 3 or more on item 3 of the HRSD;|ECT within six months;|The presence of any known or suspected contraindication to methohexital including but not limited to known allergic reactions to these agents, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, severe coronary artery disease and porphyria;|Pregnancy as determined by interview and blood work done for ECT workup;|Women who are breastfeed as determined by self-report;|Status 4 or greater according to the criteria of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.",,No,,Glen Oaks,United States,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02897843"", ""NCT02897843"")"

Naming difficulties are a persistent and common symptom in aphasia after left-hemisphere (LH) stroke. Behavioral therapy (speech and language therapy; SALT) is the mainstay treatment for post stroke aphasia. Transcranial direct cortical stimulation (tDCS) is a promising adjunct to traditional SALT. tDCS is a safe, non-invasive, non-painful electrical stimulation of the brain which modulates cortical excitability by application of weak electrical currents in the form of direct current brain polarization. It is usually administered via saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes attached to the scalp and connected to a direct current stimulator with low intensities. Most studies are conducted in the chronic phase after stroke. Because neuroplasticity is greatest early after stroke, there is reason to believe tDCS might be most effective in the acute-subacute period. However, only two studies have evaluated tDCS paired with language therapy in group studies of acute to subacute aphasic stroke patients and only one of these was sham-controlled. Furthermore, no studies (of which we are aware) have combined tDCS with therapy to facilitate naming in post stroke aphasia, as shown to be effective in studies of chronic stroke. In this study, the investigators will evaluate whether tDCS combined with SALT improves naming in individuals with aphasia in the acute and subacute post stroke period, more than SALT alone in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial.

The fact that multiple therapeutic modalities which focus on central mechanisms provide modest relief for these patients raises the possibility that the cause for the chronicity of this debilitating disorder may lie within the brain itself. We propose that changes in the cortical milieu may result from prolonged experience of pain and suffering. Our previous results suggest changes in excitatory neurotransmitter levels, connectivity between multiple brain networks, and cortical thickness coincide within central neural loci related to pain perception and modulation in FM. Interestingly, modulation of cortical activity can be achieved noninvasively by a novel tool, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which has been reported to produce lasting therapeutic effects in chronic pain, especially FM.

NSSI is the deliberate attempt to harm oneself, most often through cutting or burning, without suicidal intent. NSSI is a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy often triggered by negative emotions, especially those involving feelings of rejection. tDCS is a low-cost, portable, well-tolerated, non-invasive form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain via electrodes. Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in treating an array of conditions, depending on electrode placement, including depression and chronic pain. tDCS may also facilitate adaptive emotion regulation; researchers have also successfully used tDCS to reduce negative emotions and aggressive responses to social rejection. The investigators therefore seek to explore tDCS as a potential treatment for NSSI. This pilot feasibility study seeks 1) to examine how at-home, self-administered tDCS is tolerated in a sample of individuals who engage in frequent NSSI; 2) to gather pilot data regarding changes in emotional and neural responses during a social task after a series of tDCS sessions in this clinical population of individuals who engage in NSSI; 3) to gather pilot data on the effects of tDCS on NSSI behaviors and urges. The investigators seek to recruit a sample of 22 individuals who engage in frequent NSSI to complete all study procedures. Individuals will be randomized to receive active- or sham-tDCS for two twenty-minute applications on each of six alternating days over approximately two weeks. Participants will be trained on tDCS self-administration, which will be supervised during each session over a videoconferencing platform by a researcher.

Optimal NPS management, meaning effectively managing multiple NPS simultaneously, requires a solid understanding of the shared neural mechanism across NPS. The goal of this proof-of-concept mechanistic intervention study is to validate the causal relationship between a NPS-shared neural circuit the investigators previously discovered and various NPS. The investigators will modify a key region within the NPS-shared neural circuit [i.e. left precentral gyrus (LPG), critical for regulating visual attention] with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Our central hypothesis is that an activation of LPG and a reorganization of NPS-shared neural circuit will link to improvement in multiple NPS. Using a Stage 0 pilot randomized control trial design the investigators will recruit n = 40 older adults with informant-rated NPS that has worsened in the past 2 years, which is considered the most detrimental type of NPS in MCI. The investigators will assign participants to 4-week active anodal vs. sham LPG online tDCS group. The investigators will assess resting-state and visual attention task-related functional MRI and informant-rated NPS at baseline, and the end of week 4 and week 8, and diffusion MRI at baseline. The two primary aims are to determine the effect of tDCS on NPS-shared neural circuit (Aim 1), as well as the relationship between NPS-shared neural circuit and informant-report NPS (Aim 2). The exploratory aim will be to examine the relationship between NPS and the coherence between structural and functional aspects of the NPS-shared neural circuit. Probing the LPG via anodal tDCS provides a way to experimentally test the causal relationship between our previously discovered NPS-shared neural circuit and informant-rated NPS. The proposed research is highly innovative, while scientifically grounded, for targeting one brain region that may affect multiple NPS. Validating the hypotheses has the potential for future R01 study that directly conducts a Stage 2 trial addressing NPS in MCI, and thus ultimately improves patient's quality of life and reducing caregiving burden.",No,No,Cognitive Dysfunction,Change of activation in LPG in response to visual attention task (measured using task related fMRI) and resting FC strength between LPG and other regions within the NPS-shared neural circuit (resting fMRI),"Change of informant-rated NPI, the full version of 12 domains, including both frequency and severity (based on present symptom) scores in the past month.

During this period, and after the establishment of Menopause and non-functioning ovarian, the appearance of various symptoms that express the depletion of ovarian follicles is common; among these symptoms, the most frequently reported by women are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes. In addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The rationale for studying the effect of this technique in this context is its possible autonomic modulatory effect.

This neglect may partly account for the high inter-subject variability bemoaned by many tDCS investigators (e.g., approximately 50% of participants do not respond to tDCS) and has certainly delayed progress in the field. Therefore, research into how sex influences stimulation-related outcomes is vital to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of tDCS, which has shown great inconsistency.||Because of the menstrual cycle, the hormonal levels of women fluctuate considerably more than in men. Importantly, these hormonal variations might impact the efficacy of neuromodulatory tools, like tDCS. It is suggested that estrogen, which is high in the second follicular phase, reinforces excitatory mechanisms in the motor cortex. However, because anodal tDCS enhances cortical excitation there is also a possibility of excessive excitability. For instance, anodal tDCS may lead to overexcitation and non-optimal performance when it is applied in the second follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge on how the phases of the menstrual cycle affect tDCS performance outcomes in healthy young women because no studies have examined if and how the phases of the menstrual cycle alter tDCS efficacy.||This study is critical for determining the optimal time to administer anodal tDCS, and the ideal intensity for that administration, to achieve the most beneficial results.

The most common symptoms of PD are tremor, stiffness, slowness, and trouble with balance/walking, which lead to severe impairments in performing activities of daily living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of practical and effective add-ons to current therapeutic treatment approaches would have many benefits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can affect brain activity and can help make long-term brain changes to improve functions like walking and balance. While a few initial research studies and review articles involving tDCS have concluded that tDCS may improve PD walking and balance, many results are not meaningful in real life and several crucial issues still prevent tDCS from being a useful add-on intervention in PD. These include the selection of stimulation sites (brain regions stimulated) and tDCS electrode placement. Most studies have targeted the motor cortex (brain region that controls intentional movement), but there is evidence that the cerebellum - which helps control gait and balance, is connected to several other brain areas, and is easily stimulated with tDCS - may be a likely location to further optimize walking and balance in PD. There is also evidence that certain electrodes placements may be better than others. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of cerebellar tDCS stimulation using two different placement strategies on walking and balance in PD.||Additionally, although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of stimulation intensities (for example, 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently used in most tDCS research are less than 2 mA, which is sufficient to produce measurable improvements; but, these improvements may be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of tDCS was still being established for human subjects, careful and moderate stimulation approaches were warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher intensities (for example, up to 4 mA) have been performed in different people and were found to have no additional negative side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better established, studies exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e., 2 mA) and higher (i.e., 4 mA) intensities are necessary to determine if increasing the intensity increases the effectiveness of the desired outcome.||Prospective participants will include 10 people with mild-moderate PD that will be recruited to complete five randomly-ordered stimulation sessions, separated by at least 5 days each. Each session will involve one visit to the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (INPL) and will last for approximately one hour. Data collection is expected to take 4-6 months. Each session will include walking and balance testing performed while wearing the tDCS device.

Depression is a common complication, affecting around 5-72% of patients and is associated with various cognitive deficits and also with increased mortality - up to 50% more deaths compared to non-depressed patients. Treatment of depression after stroke is important not only to improve depressive symptoms but can also be beneficial for cognitive deficits, activities of daily living. and leads to increased survival for these patients. There are different treatments for depression after stroke, all showing inconclusive results, even though antidepressants have been effective in some groups of patients, tolerability and treatment adherence were not very good-so it is necessary that new therapeutic modalities are presented with good tolerability. In this sense, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an interesting technique that can provide interesting results, which proved to be effective for depression in some studies. This study proposes to investigate the effect of tDCS for the treatment of major depressive disorder after stroke. The proposed design is a clinical trial, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in a subsample of participants in the prospective cohort of stroke: Study of Morbidity and Mortality of stroke. They will be allocated to one of the groups: sham or active tDCS group. Participants will receive ten consecutive days of active or sham stimulation and return at the end of two weeks to evaluate the improvement in depression, cognition and functionality. As objectives, the investigators expect to see a clinical improvement of depression through scales like Hamilton, Beck and MADRS(Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), and expect improvement on cognitive tests as MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), MMSE (mini mental scale exam), FAB (frontal assessment battery) and trail test. Another goal is to see improvement in markers related to depression as BDNF, cortisol, interleukins and heart rate variability.

Present therapeutic concepts suffer from limited efficacy, and thus new innovative therapies are needed. Neuroscientific studies have shown that prefrontal function in alcohol-dependent patients is impaired, leading to cognitive disturbances, and continuation of dependent behaviour. The results of pilot studies demonstrate that activation of prefrontal cortices via non-invasive brain stimulation improves cognitive performance in healthy subjects, and diminishes dependency-related behaviour in patients. The investigators aim to develop a stimulation protocol suited to induce a clinically relevant improvement of prefrontal functions in patients suffering from alcohol dependency.

It has been used for several years and in many populations to improve physical and psychological outcomes. Although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of stimulation intensities (e.g., 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently employed in most tDCS research are ≤ 2 mA, which are sufficient to elicit measurable improvements; but, these improvements might be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of tDCS was still being established for human subjects, careful and moderate approaches to stimulation protocols were warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher intensities, i.e. up to 4 mA, has been performed in many populations and was found to have no additional negative side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better established, work exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e. 2 mA) and higher (i.e. 4 mA) intensities is necessary to determine if increasing intensity increases the effectiveness of the desired outcome.||Prospective participants will include 40 healthy young adults (all right-side dominant) that will be recruited to complete four randomly ordered stimulation sessions (Baseline, 2 mA, 4 mA, and sham), separated by at least 5 days.

It is the main cause of long-term disability among adults in the UK despite a fall in age-specific stroke incidence, with a growing number of survivors remaining dependent for activities of daily living. While most people with stroke regain walking ability, upper limb problems with no voluntary arm and hand activity, affecting a third of people after stroke, has a poor prognosis. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure used to polarise brain regions through the application of weak direct currents and has the potential to develop into a useful aid to treatment strategies in neurorehabilitation. Recent literature into the application of tDCS in people with arm and hand impairments after stroke has shown promising results on upper limb function measures like the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test. Furthermore, a recent pilot study evaluated a six-week training programme combining tDCS with robot-assisted hand training and reported significant improvements in upper limb function. However, the robot in the latter study focused on single-plane distal movements only and long-term effects of the tDCS were not assessed.

Severe UE impairment, especially dysfunction of hand, can greatly impact stroke patients' daily living independence and quality of life. However, treatment effect of current interventions is still limited. Nick Ward and Leonardo Cohen suggested 5 intervention strategies for stroke motor recovery: （1） reduction of somatosensory input from the intact; （2） increase in somatosensory input from the paretic; （3） anesthesia of a body part proximal to the paretic hand; （4） activity within the affected motor cortex may be up-regulated; （5） activity within the intact motor cortex may be down-regulated. Recent studies have shown each strategy to be effective in stroke patients with mild or moderate UE impairment. However, evidence for people with severe UE impairment after stroke remains unclear. Since research has found a greater effect for combined strategies than a single strategy, this proposal develops a combined intervention with the above 5 strategies, named ""transcranial direct current stimulation （tDCS） combined sensory modulation intervention"". This intervention is expected to be most effective for people with severe UE impairment after stroke.||In addition, neuroimaging can provide in vivo information about the brain plasticity which underpinning the motor recovery after stroke. However, image indexes that can be used in stroke patients with severe UE impairment remained examined. Therefore, this proposal has 3 aims: （1） to examine the treatment effect of the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"" in stroke patients with severe UE impairment; （2） to examine the underline mechanism of the efficacy of ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"" using neuroimaging technology.||Methods:||This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial which will recruit 60 people who have had stroke onset more than 6 months and have severe UE motor impairment. All participants will be randomly assigned into 2 groups. The experimental group will be given the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"", combining bilateral tDCS stimulation, anesthesia techniques and repetitive passive motor training. The control group is given sham tDCS, sham anesthesia and repetitive passive motor training. Each group will be evaluated for outcomes at 4 time points （i.e. baseline, post-intervention, 3 months and 6months post-intervention）. The immediate and long-term effect of the interventions will be examined.||Primary outcome indicators include upper extremity impairment measures. Secondary outcome measures include upper extremity function, activities of daily living function, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging （fMRI）, and corticospinal tract structural integrity using diffusion spectrum imaging （DSI）. Fifteen subjects of each group will be assessed 2 times （i.e., prior to the intervention and after the intervention） for fMRI and DSI scan.||Anticipatory results and contributions:||The results of the studies are expected to present a potentially effective intervention for stroke patients with severe impaired UE motor. Imaging evidence of brain plasticity for this particular intervention is also provided. The results will contribute to our understanding of brain plasticity for UE motor recovery after stroke.

To address this gap, the current proposal aims to combine two forms of neuromodulation sequentially, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at different frequencies of rTMS. Homeostatic plasticity, the initial activation state of a targeted circuit, is a key determinant of whether rTMS induces long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) Yet, homeostatic plasticity is rarely measured or controlled in rTMS studies. We aim to control homeostatic plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS prior to rTMS delivery. The protocol included an exploratory aim to examine physiological changes in patients with tinnitus but this aim was not part of the pilot physiological investigation and it could not be completed due to funding limitations.",No,Yes,Tinnitus,"TEPs refer to TMS-evoked EEG potentials. The P100 amplitude of TEPs is one means of assessing cortical excitability. The P100 amplitude has been shown to be a reliable metric in studies of healthy subjects.

Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols- in a polarity and site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. However, it is unknown how the motor cortex excitability changes that follow tDCS relate to the increase in motor learning and recovery potential. The currently upheld hypothesis is that motor learning needs to be synchronized in time with electrical stimulation (paired stimulation), but recent results from our lab suggest that tDCS also increases skill learning after stimulation has ended (unpaired stimulation). If this is true, tDCS has a much larger therapeutic window and is a more valuable clinical tool than currently believed. Therefore, the investigators want to investigate how late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affects the increase in skill learning normally seen with tDCS when applied 24 hours before training. The outcome of this study can provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.||Objective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS in chronic stroke patients on skill learning 24 hours later.||Study design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Chronic stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main objective of the study is to determine the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS on skill learning 24 hours later. As a motor learning paradigm, the investigators will use a circuit tracking task which chronic stroke patients perform better if tDCS is applied concurrently. During this task, patients have to trace a cursor over a circuit as fast and accurately as possible by moving a computer mouse. Skill will be quantified by calculating a combined speed/ accuracy score and skill improvement compared to baseline (LI; the learning index) will be compared between the sham, conventional unpaired tDCS, conventional paired tDCS groups and the late LTP-like plasticity tDCS groups.",,,Stroke|Paresis,Motor skill retention will be assessed on the circuit game,Maximum Grip Force will be assessed using a Jamar Dynamometer,84,Actual,,,,,Inclusion Criteria:||Chronic (> 6 months) stroke patient|Aged 18-79 years|Motor deficit in the upper limb due to the stroke||Exclusion Criteria:||Absence of recordable MEPs from the ADM after TMS|Absence of voluntary movement (Fugl-Meyer < III)|Head injury or the presence of intracranial metal or intracranial lesions|History of cranial irradiation|History of epilepsy|Presence of a pacemaker|Taking anticonvulsant or neuroleptic medication|Substance abuse|Inability to understand instructions|History of psychiatric disorders,,No,23316151|33175411|28751226,Rotterdam,Netherlands,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02399540"", ""NCT02399540"")"

The investigators have recently shown that the frontopolar cortex plays a crucial in motivating the exertion of rewarded effort in younger adults. The goal of the current study is to determine whether frontopolar cortex plays a crucial role for motivation also in older adults and may thus be a promising target for improving the motivation deficits in healthy aging.

These dysfunctions have been linked to a deficit in prefrontal cortex activity. The latter has an inhibitory influence on limbic regions -especially the amygdala- involved in the generation of emotions. By this means, the prefrontal cortex intervenes in the control of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system whp are responsible for the physiological components of the emotion, including the variations of the cardiac rhythm (HRV: heart rate variability).||In emotionally demanding situations, the activity of the prefrontal cortex is generally associated with an increase in parasympathetic activity that is exerted by stimulation of the vagus nerve. In patients with anxio-depressive disorder, there is a decrease in the activity of the autonomic nervous system whose variability in heart rate is a recognized marker.||Many studies show a beneficial impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) on anxio-depressive symptoms, particularly when a particular area is targeted: the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. The impacts of this intervention are multiple and aim in particular to modulate the activity of the autonomic nervous system to promote regulation.||Biofeedback HRV is a technique that allows you to learn how to modulate your heart rate by means of respiratory control exercises. The patient receives an immediate feedback on the effectiveness of his learning (basic principle of bio-feedback). This intervention will allow to act on the parasympathetic activity and to promote a vagal tone adequate to the emotional regulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the favorable impact of HRV biofeedback on the reduction of anxious and depressive symptoms.||Since the vagus nerve seems to be a primary pathway in physiologically emotional regulation, and considering that vagal tone can be stimulated by both the activity of the prefrontal cortex and through respiratory control, it appears interesting to study the association of t-DCS with HRV biofeedback techniques.||The first objective of this study is to show that HRV biofeedback training coupled with t-DCS is associated with a greater decrease in anxious symptomatology. The secondary objective of the study is to show that a coupling of these two techniques is associated with an increase of the variability of the cardiac rhythm as well as a more important decrease of the depressive symptomatology.",No,No,Depressive Disorder,"Questionnaire with 20 questions, each with 4 possible answers.

In contrast, neurophysiologically guided treatments might provide an alternative avenue, since these can normalize brain alterations without side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears useful in the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine, probably because of its modifying and re-balancing influence on neuronal activity. Yet, to test for the efficacy of tDCS in a clinically acceptable way, it is necessary to apply not only tDCS but also a ""sham"" placebo, which is often neglected in tDCS stimulation studies. Further, tDCS needs to be applied in a large (n > 20) sample of well-defined migraine patients, which would be advantageous, compared to previously published work. Monitoring sources of regional neuronal alterations in migraineurs prior and after tDCS is essential to investigate physiological mechanisms of tDCS.

These types of injuries often involve axonal damage to pre frontal brain areas, which mediate various cognitive and behavioral functions. Dorsolateral prefrontal circuit lesions cause executive dysfunction, orbitofrontal circuit lesions lead to personality changes characterized by disinhibition and anterior cingulate circuit lesions present with apathy. Patients who suffered traumatic frontal lobe damage often demonstrate a lasting, profound disturbance of emotional regulation and social cognition.||Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces persisting excitability changes in the human motor cortex. this effect depends on the stimulation polarity and is specific to the site of stimulation. Interacting with cortical activity, by means of cortical stimulation, can positively affect the short-term cognitive performance and improve the rehabilitation potential of neurologic patients. In this respect, preliminary evidence suggests that cortical stimulation may play a role in treating aphasia, unilateral neglect, and other cognitive disorders.||Several possible mechanisms can account for the effects of tDCS and other methods on cognitive performance. They all reflect the potential of these methods to improve the subject's ability to relearn or to acquire new strategies for carrying out behavioral tasks. It was also found that Activation of prefrontal cortex by tDCS reduces appetite for risk during ambiguous decision making.||In this tDCS study the investigator uses one anode and one cathode electrode placed over the scalp to modulate a particular area of the central nervous system (CNS).

Brain injury stemming from stroke, affecting the corticospinal system results in weakness, alterations in muscle tone and incoordination during the performance of functional tasks. Recovery of functional task performance after injury to the corticospinal system involves a residual neural network that engages the premotor cortex, frontal cortex and supplementary motor cortex. In particular, the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is anatomically and physiologically poised to reorganize and support motor recovery after corticospinal damage. The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of stimulating the ipsilesional PMd in adults with chronic stroke using noninvasive anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during the training sessions of a 4-week circuit-based, UE, task-related training (TRT) program. Pilot data from six adults, using anodal tDCS over the injured PMd just before each session of TRT, led to significant improvements in UE function in 5 of the 6 adults after only 4 weeks of training. We will assess the motor function of both arms using clinical assessments immediately before and after the 4-week TRT program. In addition to effects of tDCS-primed UE-TRT on clinical outcomes, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the changes in neural network reorganization.

It affects around 15% of people in the UK. About 20% of people with tinnitus experience symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life including sleep disturbances, difficulties with hearing and concentration, social isolation, anxiety, depression, irritation or stress. Most common clinical management strategies for tinnitus include education and advice combined with some form of sound therapy. The effects of these management options are, however, variable. Currently, the exact aetiology of tinnitus is unknown although maladaptive plasticity due to sensorineural hearing loss is thought to play a big role. Neuroimaging studies have pointed to over-activation or excessive spontaneous activity within the central auditory cortex. Furthermore, electrophysiological techniques have confirmed the frontal cortex's role in tinnitus through dysfunctional top-down modulation.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neurostimulation technique in which weak currents (1-2 mA's) are delivered to the brain, thereby depolarising or hyperpolarising neurons within the desired region of cortex. tDCS is a non-invasive and easy to apply tool, delivered by applying two surface electrode to a patients head. It has previously been used as a treatment for depression, stroke rehabilitation, and cognitive enhancement.||Some studies have indicated potential benefit of tDCS in tinnitus patients, but this has not yet been investigated within the UK. Neuromodulation therapies should deliver a permanent reduction in tinnitus percept by driving the neuroplastic changes necessary to interrupt abnormal levels of oscillatory cortical activity and restore typical levels of activity. This change in activity should alter or interrupt the tinnitus percept (reduce or extinguish) and this should be concomitant with a change in the level of self-reported tinnitus handicap. The currently ongoing Cochrane review of neuromodulation (desynchronisation) for tinnitus in adults found mixed evidence for the electrical stimulation therapies for tinnitus, including tDCS. However, the review also found that the most recent tDCS trials that have used greater numbers of treatment sessions found significant reductions in tinnitus symptom severity, anxiety, and depression. Authors concluded that these findings warrant further trials of tDCS. Research studies using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggested changes in oscillatory activity in different frequency bands that might be associated with tinnitus, however a consistent picture has not yet emerged. Reduction of this abnormal activity might signify a reduction in the level or perceived severity of TI and could potentially be used as a valuable indicator of the course of TI treatment.||In this project specific changes in brain activity that happen during a new treatment approach for tinnitus - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)- will be investigated.

According to the estimates, 12,500 people suffer a new or recurrent ischemic stroke in Chile annually, which shows the magnitude of the problem. Motor impairment of the upper limb (UL) stands out as the principal sequel after a CVA (50% of the patients experience it), and the Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is the rehabilitation approach that shows more scientific evidence today. Even though patients reach certain recuperation levels through this approach, results are still insufficient since 50-80% of the patients continue having upper limb motor impairment after completing standard rehabilitation. Because of this, it is pertinent to conduct research to explore new rehabilitation strategies to reduce the impairment indexes and to provide information for decision making based on evidence.||Recent studies on functional neuroimaging propose that there is an abnormal balance in the motor cortex excitability after stroke - relative under-excitability in the affected hemisphere and over-excitability in the unaffected hemisphere (with the consequent inhibitory influence on ipsilesional regions) in stroke patient with moderate motor impairment. This imbalance in the hemispheres function would limit the possibilities of a greater recovery. Then, in order to reestablish brain balance, the investigators proposed that the early introduction of noninvasive techniques of brain stimulation, such as tDCS, to the motor rehabilitation training could promote improvement of upper limb function in patients with stroke. However, we lack studies that confirm the benefits of using these techniques, define the most appropriate protocols, and determine what patients and under which evolving stages would be the best candidates for treatment.||This study aims to ""compare the effectiveness of seven days of bi-hemispheric tDCS, both active and sham, combined with modified CIMT (mCIMT) in the motor and functional recovery of the hemiparetic upper limb in hospitalized patients with subacute unihemispheric stroke at Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile and Hospital San José"".

Using dead weights, the 1RM (i.e. the maximal load that an individual can lift once) will be estimated by the 10RM in order to avoid tendino-muscular injuries and fatigue. The 10RM will be determined for the muscles playing a key role in the functional performance of the upper limb, which are the wrist extensors and the elbow and shoulder flexors. In addition, the grip muscles of the affected hand will be trained with a JAMAR® dynamometer. Participants' maximal grip force will be determined and used to dose the training of the hand muscles and its progression. The training will begin and end by a 5-minute warm-up and relaxation period comprising of active movements of the trained muscles.|An anodal montage over the ipsilesional hemisphere will be used where the anode will be placed over the ipsilesional M1 area whereas the cathode will be placed on the contralateral supra-orbital region.For the tDCS real group, a direct current will be generated by a tDCS stimulator and gradually increased in a ramp-like fashion over the first 8 seconds until a maximum intensity of 2 mA is achieved. The tDCS will be applied for 20 minutes during each training session for a total of 12 sessions.

This has a tremendous impact on the quality of life and the ability for stroke survivors to live independently. While exercise is considered essential to any rehabilitation program, its benefits are generally far from optimal because of the lack of proper dosing in terms of intensity. One way to tackle this problem is to develop better tools that could predict an individual's potential and then adjust the intensity of exercise accordingly. One such predicting tool exists and consists of using non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to assess the integrity of descending motor pathways originating from the brain. TMS consists of applying a magnetic wand near the scalp to stimulate brain cells without inducing pain or discomfort. One goal of the current proposal is to use TMS to test the integrity of the motor pathway in chronic stroke survivors. The level of responses to TMS will be used to classify participants in terms of potential for recovery and then, to determine the optimal level of exercise. The study will also examine the effect of another non-invasive brain stimulation technique called transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation-tDCS to determine whether it can enhance the response to strength training exercise in the affected arm. Half of the participants will be trained with the tDCS on, while the other half will be trained with the stimulator off. The training program will last 4 weeks; 3X/week. Both clinical and neurophysiological measures will be performed to determine the impact of the strength training intervention on participants.

Modern theory-based language therapies (LT) with proved efficacy in chronic PSA are brief (weeks), intensive, and oriented to specific domains (e.g., anomia). However, in order to maximize therapeutic benefits, it becomes essential to implement complementary strategies that boost gains in language, communication and behaviour and also to identify predictors of treatment response (demographics, anatomical) that enable to customize interventions adjusting them to each profile (linguistic deficits, brain structure and connectivity). Our group has repeatedly shown that LT combined with cognitive enhancing drugs (CED) (e.g., Donepezil and Memantine) are safe and promote better outcomes that when these interventions are administered separately. Moreover, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are also emerging as a promising treatment option for chronic PSA.

However, the problem is that this doesn't work for everyone, and researchers do not know why. One reason may be that TDCS is currently applied using a one-size-fits-all approach. Researchers apply the same type of TDCS to everyone, assuming the stroke affects everyone in the same way. But, researchers know this is not the case. For example, each person will likely have different amounts of damage to brain regions that control movements. A better understanding of how the stroke uniquely affects a person's brain will help us to know which is the correct type of TDCS to apply for that person.

This study will investigate whether the pairing of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation and cognitive training can enhance functional connectivity between DLPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We have identified higher functional connectivity between DLPFC and NAcc in alcoholics that have successfully maintained abstinence for extended periods of time (7 years). This paired-neuromodulation approach can potentially be used as a therapeutic intervention to decrease substance use probability in addiction (e.g. opioid use disorder). The long term goal is to develop new addiction treatments that support long-term abstinence in opioid use disorder.

In humans, this ability is disrupted among those who suffer a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder and autism. Additionally, there is evidence of substantial individual differences in BF within the healthy population.||Two known neurobiological mechanisms which relate to BF performance are variation in dopamine (DA) and serotonin (SE) function. One particular brain regions which has been heavily implicated in BF is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the dorsolateral PFC receiving a largely DA innervation and the dorsomedial PFC a SE input. Studies have demonstrated that damage to parts of PFC including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), for example, impairs reversal learning (a form of BF) whereas lesions of the dorsolateral PFC affect attentional set-shifting (another measure of BF).||In humans, putative augmentation of DA efflux via administration of the DA and norepinephrine precursor tyrosine has been shown to improve task-switching performance, and inhibitory control suggesting a causal role of DA in regulating BF. Similarly, putative depletion of serotonin neurotransmission via tryptophan depletion procedures has been shown to reduce the BOLD response during performance monitoring and increase perseverative behaviour.||One important strategy (in humans) to observe whether the PFC is causally involved in BF performance, is by reversible electrical stimulation of the PFC, so that PFC cells could be inhibited or excited while a participant is performing a BF task. In recent years, several laboratories have taken advantage of a relatively new technology known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to study the relationship between brain function and behaviour. Using this technique, increases or decreases in cortical excitability are partly determined by the polarity of the stimulation; increases occur under the anode electrode whereas decreases occur under the negatively charged cathode.||Using this approach, several studies have shown that anodal and cathodal stimulation over the PFC can have a number of effects on BF performance, with general improvements during anodal stimulation and impairments during cathodal. If this is the case, one important step that remains to be understood is whether dopamine and serotonin are causally related to these outcomes when neurons of the dLPFC/dMPFC are either excited or inhibited via tDCS.||Thus, the specific novelty of this study rests in combining a psychopharmacological approach (i.e. tyrosine/tryptophan loading) with selective neuroanatomical (i.e. dorsolateral/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) inhibition of cells via tDCS while participants are performing BF tasks. By doing so, we will be able to establish whether increased dopaminergic/serotonergic output to the PFC is a necessary requirement for BF performance.",No,No,,Total Number of errors (e.g. 1-200)|Mean Errors per reversal (e.g. 1-20),,24,Actual,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Aged between 18 and 30 years|In good health|Agrees to fast overnight prior to testing||Exclusion Criteria:||Presence of cardiac, hepatic, renal, or neurological disorders|Presence of damaged or diseased skin on your face and scalp, or a sensitive scalp|A history of alcohol or drug addiction, or severe psychiatric illness|Taking drugs which may lower seizure threshold (i.e. epilepsy)|In a state of pregnancy|Having slept less than 6 hours the night before testing|A history of migraine or headaches|A history of taking antidepressants|A history of taking tyrosine supplements",,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,Sheffield,United Kingdom,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT03068884"", ""NCT03068884"")"

Higher SI values indicate greater interlimb step length asymmetry.|Ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior) strength was measured with the subject seated and with the test foot strapped to a handheld dynamometer. An ankle dorsiflexion test was selected based on evidence indicating that the tibialis anterior is under the greatest corticospinal control. Maximum dorsiflexion force was calculated based on the highest force measured over three attempts. Results are reported for data obtained at baseline Day-1 (D1) and at follow-up on Day-5, 24-hours post-intervention.|Balance was measured using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), which has been found to be valid for use in persons with SCI. The BBS total score was calculated for each participant at each time point, and the median score for each group was calculated. The total range of scores for the BBS equals 0-56, with higher scores from baseline indicating greater balance performance and lower scores from baseline indicating worsened balance performance. Data reported were obtained at baseline Day-1 (D1) and at follow-up on Day-5, 24-hours post-intervention.|The fear of falling may be a major concern for persons with mobility impairments and may limit one's confidence or ability to perform activities of daily living. Fear of falling may also limit an individual's performance of specific overground motor tasks irrespective of functional ability to perform that task. Therefore, the fear of falling was an important factor to consider relative to the mobility interventions employed in the present study. The FES-I total score was calculated for each participant at each time point, and the median for each group was recorded. The total range of scores possible for the FES-I is equal to 16-64, with lower total scores indicating decreased fear of falling. Data reported were obtained at baseline Day-1 (D1) and at follow-up on Day-5, 24-hours post-intervention.|The Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes (SCATS) was used to assess the impact of motor skill training + sham stimulation and motor training + tDCS on spasticity. SCATS is well correlated with electrophysiological measures of spasticity and is better correlated with self-reported measures of spasm frequency than the Ashworth test. Total SCATS scores for each limb were summed and median values were obtained for each group. The total range of scores possible for the SCATS is 0-18, with a total score of 0 indicating no lower limb spasticity and higher total scores indicating greater spasticity severity. Data reported were obtained at baseline Day-1 (D1) and at follow-up on Day-5, 24-hours post-intervention.|The modified 5-times sit-to-stand test was used as a measure of functional lower extremity strength. In this test, the participant was seated on a mat table with height adjusted to 80% of lower extremity length. The time required to complete 5 repetitions of standing up and sitting down (without using the upper extremities for assistance) was recorded. The average time to complete the test was calculated at each time point for each group. Lower sit-to-stand times indicate greater functional lower extremity strength. Results are reported for data obtained at baseline Day-1 (D1) and at follow-up on Day-5, 24-hours post-intervention.|Knee extensor (quadriceps) strength was measured with participants seated, with the test leg strapped to a handheld dynamometer. Prior studies have shown that a single session of tDCS improves quadriceps strength in persons with stroke. Maximum knee extensor force was analyzed based on the maximum force produced over three attempts. Results are reported for data obtained at baseline Day-1 (D1) and at follow-up on Day-5, 24-hours post-intervention.|Functional walking capacity was measured based on 2-minute walk test distance. The use of the 2-minute rather than the 6-minute walk test allowed us to include individuals whose impairments result in inability to walk for 6 minutes.

Due to economic realities on most stroke units, SLT can often not be given with optimal intensity in the first weeks after the stroke. Developing new adjuvant therapies which may render SLT sessions more effective is thus one approach to improve rehabilitation outcome. Recent functional imaging studies in post-stroke aphasia have shown that the recruitment of brain regions in the unaffected hemisphere seems to be an inferior strategy for recovery of language function as compared to re-activation of brain regions in the vicinity of the infarct. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are new methods to modulate brain activity. Evidence from our own feasibility study in sub-acute stroke suggests that these new techniques, when applied in conjunction with conventional SLT, may help to normalize brain activation patterns and might yield better rehabilitation outcome than SLT alone. With NORTHSTAR, we propose a multicenter proof-of-concept study to investigate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of these new non-invasive brain stimulation methods as adjuvant therapies for subacute post-stroke aphasia.||Our goal is to determine the most effective brain stimulation modality to decrease inhibition onto the left side of the brain.

Treatments that can probe or even enhance plasticity have potential to be of great clinical and research value. Non-invasive neuromodulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising method for modulating neural plasticity. tDCS delivers low-intensity direct current to cortical areas, thereby facilitating or inhibiting neural activity in a polarity specific manner. Due to its low cost and safety, tDCS has been employed in a wide variety of studies, but much remains unknown regarding its mechanism of action in humans. Experiments carried out in animal and tissue models indicate that tDCS modulates synaptic plasticity mechanisms of long term potentiation and depression (LTP/D), however, these findings have never been translated to human subjects, limiting the practical utility of the research.

It has been shown that TMS, tDCS, tACS and C/PNS can modulate motor function in healthy volunteers, as well as in patients with neurological disorders such as stroke.||One fundamental problem is that the optimal parameters of stimulation to modulate motor function by all of these techniques are not known. The purpose of this protocol is to explore within safe guidelines, the effects of different stimulation parameters on motor cortical function, on oscillatory brain dynamics measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), on eye movements, and on fMRI activation. In addition, this protocol will be used to train new fellows coming to NINDS Human Cortical Physiology Section (HCPS) in the use of TMS, tDCS, tACS and C/PNS techniques.||We expect that information emerging from these studies will allow us to 1) optimize experimental protocols or stimulation parameters to collect pilot data in healthy volunteer for future patient-oriented hypothesis-driven protocols,2)to collect pilot data for power analysis for future patient-oriented hypothesis driven protocols, and 3) to train new fellows in the use of these different methods.||Study Population||Up to 1500 healthy volunteers, age 18 and older.||Design||Healthy volunteers will receive one or more of the following types of stimulation alone or in combination: (1) single- and paired-pulse TMS with inter-stimulus intervals of greater than 1s and up to 20s and intensities of up to 100% of stimulator output; (2) 1 Hz TMS for up to 30mins and up to 115% of resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity; (3) tDCS applied at an intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up to 60mins, as long the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (4) tACS applied at a peak-to-peak intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up to 60 minutes, minutes, as long the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (5) C/PNS applied alone with intensities below 130% of the peripherally-elicited-motor-threshold for up to 2 hours, or intensities up to 300% of sensory threshold when C/PNS is paired with TMS. All of these parameters of stimulation and procedures have safely been used as previously reported in the literature. Sham stimulations will be delivered for each modality as scientifically needed. Some substudies may involve recording of behavior or brain activity only (such as behavioral testing, MRI, and MEG) if brain stimulation targets are unknown. This information can help design future brain stimulation protocols.||Each subject may participate in up to 20 sessions. A single session may last no longer than 8 hours to allow for initial testing paradigm followed by retests or performing other components of the same substudy later in the day. Appropriate rest breaks and meal breaks will occur during long sessions. Subjects participate in one experimental session per day under this protocol. The 20 experimental sessions will be scheduled over a twenty-year period. CTDB is used to track the number of sessions per subject so it does not exceed 20 sessions. The AIs are responsible for entering the subjects/sessions into CTDB.||We will test the effects of these different forms of stimulation on motor cortical excitability, cognitive and motor behavioral tasks, and brain state measures derived from neuroimaging data (i.e. - MRI, fMRI, MEG and EEG). Stimulation may be applied before, after, or during physiological (i.e. motor evoked potentials, M-wave, F-wave, or H-Reflexes), neuroimaging or behavioral measures.||Under this protocol, we conduct:||Exploratory Sub-studies: These substudies are exploratory in nature and are conducted in order to develop information to generate better informed future hypotheses and/or power analyses. We have set an upper limit of 40 subjects per sub-study.||Hypothesis-Testing Sub-studies: Hypothesis-testing sub-studies are studies with specific hypotheses to be tested. These sub-studies undergo statistical and PIRC review after 6 subjects per group (e.g., after 12 subjects, 6 per arm, if two groups are studied), before additional subjects can be recruited. Together, the P.I. and PIRC will decide whether to continue the sub-study with more subjects without an amendment or whether an amendment or protocol would be necessary. A memo requesting a review of hypothesis-testing sub-studies for possible additional enrollment (beyond 6) will be sent to PIRC and the statistical reviewer.||This protocol is ...",No,No,,in data analysis|in data analysis|in data analysis,,1007,Actual,,,,,"INCLUSION CRITERIA:||Age 18 and older|Willingness and ability to give consent|Normal neurological examination|Clearly dominant handedness (right or left) as assessed by Handedness scales||EXCLUSION CRITERIA:||Any severe or progressive neurological disorder or severe medical condition, or history of seizures|Chronic use of medications acting primarily on the central nervous system, which lower the seizure threshold or significantly alter cortical excitability such as antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine, clozapine), tricyclic or other antidepressants, or prescription stimulants.|Pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments|Diagnosis of drug dependence made by a health care provider (ICD-9-CM code 304)|Staff from our section",,No,9474057|7922470|10825706,Bethesda,United States,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00453505"", ""NCT00453505"")"

This research is expected to help develop techniques and hypotheses for future research on these topics.||We will conduct:||Pilot Substudy: Pilot substudies are exploratory in nature, in order to develop enough information to generate a hypothesis. The criterion for transition to a new full protocol will be acquisition of sufficient information to generate a power analysis. There are no enrollment limitations for pilot substudies.|Hypothesis-Testing Substudy is defined as a study with a specific hypothesis to be tested that can be completed with a few healthy volunteers or patients. Hypothesis-testing substudies will undergo statistical and PIRC reviews after 6 subjects (if there is one group) or after 12 (6 per arm) if two groups are studied before additional subjects are recruited. In the event of subject dropout or unsuccessful recording, replacement will be recruited. Together, the P.I. and PIRC will decide whether to continue the hypothesis substudy with more subjects without an amendment or whether an amendment or new protocol would be necessary. A memo requesting a review of hypothesis-testing substudies for possible additional enrollment will be sent to PIRC and the statistical reviewer. The memo will be forwarded to the CNS IRB.|Technical development of new experimental paradigms and data analysis methods.||This protocol includes only non-invasive techniques with minimal risk (MRI, EEG, MEG, EMG, tDCS).||Study Population:||We plan to recruit up to 120 healthy volunteers aged 18-65.||Design:||We will design small projects that are pertinent to the theme of scale-free brain activity and conscious/unconscious processing. We will investigate healthy volunteers in the resting state or while they perform simple motor or sensory tasks. If a hypothesis testing substudy leads to results of interest and if a larger population is necessary to reach statistical significance, a separate protocol will be submitted with a priori hypotheses, specific study design and power analysis adapted from the pilot or exploratory substudies performed in the present protocol.||In the substudies, brain activity of healthy human volunteers will be monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), or simultaneous MEG-EEG. Anatomical MRI will be collected in some subjects to allow better localization of brain dynamics. Because transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is ideally suited to modulate the slow component of scale-free brain activity, we will also investigate the effect of tDCS on brain activity and/or behavioral performance in cognitive tasks. tDCS will be administered sequentially, but not simultaneously, with brain-activity monitoring by fMRI/MEG/EEG. Most experiments will be conducted in conjunction with cognitive tasks. In some experiments, we will study resting-state brain function, during which spontaneous brain activity is collected without a specific externally administered task.||Outcome Measures:||MRI: to analyze measures such as the anatomical structures of the brain (using structural MRI); amplitude of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal (using fMRI); cerebral blood flow [using arterial spin labeling (ASL)] and different neurotransmitter levels in brain regions of interest [using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)].||EEG and MEG: to quantify measures such as power spectrum, event- or task-related potentials, synchronization/desynchronization, and coherence between sensors or sources located close to the brain areas of interest.||tDCS: to analyze changes in behavioral measures and/or fMRI/EEG/MEG activity caused by tDCS.||Behavioral measures: to quantify measures such as hit rate, reaction times, electromyography (EMG) patterns.||We may measure autonomic data during the course of the experiment (such as heart rate, respiration, end-tidal CO2, skin conductance), which will be correlated with the outcome measures.",,,,,,154,Actual,,,,,"INCLUSION CRITERIA:||A subject can be included if he/she:||is in good general health;||is between 18 and 65 years old;||is capable of understanding the procedures and requirements of this study;||is willing and able to provide his/her own informed consent.||EXCLUSION CRITERIA:||A subject will be excluded if he/she:||has a contraindication to MR scanning such as the following: pregnancy, aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings); insulin pump as per the NMR Safety Screening Form.||underwent brain surgery, who have a central nervous system illness, neurological lesion, a psychiatric history or recurrent migraines that require medication will also be excluded from this study: Healthy volunteer form.||has uncontrolled medical problems, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pulmonary or airway disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease.||has metal in the cranial cavity and/or holes in the skull made by trauma or surgery.||cannot lie comfortably flat on their back for up to 180 minutes in the MRI scanner||has claustrophobia||Subjects may participate in this study, but will not be allowed to have a 7T MRI scan if they have metallic dental crowns or a bridge.||Subjects may participate in the study, but will not have tDCS if they have broken skin or a wound in the area where electrodes will be placed.",,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,20471349|21957241|21532743,Bethesda,United States,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01974427"", ""NCT01974427"")"

Some of the changes in the central nervous system are associated with how the brain adapts to the process of different stimuli. There are several physiological mechanisms that regulates how the brain adapts to changes and one of these mechanisms is called homeostatic plasticity (or equilibrium plasticity ). In healthy participants homeostatic plasticity mechanisms have been tested and considered normal, whereas in patients with chronic conditions, such as low back pain, this mechanism was shown to be dysfunctional. However, it is unknown when this difference in the pain system develops. It is possible that homeostatic mechanism becomes impaired over a period of time.

However, work organization (especially in risky job like airplane control or medical profession) and pathologies due to an overload of work (like burn-out) seems to be directly linked to neural fatigue. One of the consequences of neural fatigue is to alter decision-making.

Results, although often promising, are not unequivocal, possibly due to different stimulation parameters and sites, or non-homogenous patient selection. tDCS has been widely applied but few studies have focused on tACS which has the advantage of potentially entraining brain oscillations at the same frequency of stimulation. This overcomes the basic mechanism of tDCS which deploys anodal or cathodal currents to broadly excite or inhibit supposedly dysfunctional underlying cortex.||Whether a stimulation paradigm based on sound neurophysiological markers could provide a better and longer-lasting clinical outcome has not yet been ascertained.||The investigators aim to establish, with a trans-disease approach, categories characterized by defective EEG oscillatory activity and related dysfunctional networks. This classification, expected as the result of the first stage of this project, will guide the stimulation paradigm: categories with a pathologically low-band EEG prevalence will be treated with high-frequency tACS, and vice-versa, while the stimulation site will correspond to the defective sites of pathological EEG band maps. Parkinson's disease (PD), the EEG marker of which is a shift towards fast frequencies, and neuropathic pain (NP), with an EEG prevalence of slow bands, will be considered.||In order to categorize pathologies on the basis of their EEG frequencies, EEG power spectrums will be derived from resting EEG, and cortical oscillatory reactivity will be assessed by EEG-TMS (electroencephalographic-Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) co-registration. This method appears to elicit state-dependent brain oscillatory response and is expected to support power spectrum data. The identified prevailing EEG band will be used subsequently to reconstruct scalp EEG band distribution. tACS paradigms will be tailored according to these findings: the anode will be placed over the scalp area corresponding to the dysfunctional rhythm and frequency will be set in order to correct the prevailing EEG band (slow stimulation if fast frequencies prevail, and vice-versa).||The translational element of this research proposal will consist of its clinical application in day-to-day practice for the benefit of people with the target conditions. The patient-groups, after undergoing the neurophysiology studies, will be tested with disease-specific scales and a neuropsychological battery.

Error correction based on the fronto-parietal loop is subject to error information inherent within visual feedback. On the other hand, cerebellar activity for restoration of efferent copy involves in operation of feedforward mechanism. Therefore, the amount of error feedback and excitation of cerebellum are keyed to effectiveness of motor learning. Although postural training is of empirical value to prevent falling from the elderly, yet none of previous studies have ever been devoted to improve effectiveness of postural training via manipulations of visual error feedback and cerebellar stimulation.||From the aspect of cognition-motor interaction, the present proposal is a three-year project intended to promote effectiveness of postural training for the elderly. In the first year, feedback-based training benefits from a dynamic postural task under the conditions of different visual size of error feedback (error-reducing feedback, error-enhancing feedback, and fixed error feedback) will be contrasted. In the second year, feedforward-based training benefits from a dynamic postural task by application of cerebellum transcranial electrical stimulation (ctDCS) of different modes (direct current vs. noise vs. sham) will be contrasted. In the third year, the proposal will examine whether postural training with combined approach (error-enhancing feedback and ctDCS) could result in a superior training benefit to those of error-enhancing feedback alone and ctDCS alone approaches. In addition to innovative training intervention, this proposal will make use of current non-linear analyses on EEG signals and postural sway with graph analysis and heading analysis, respectively.

This pain is known to be one of the worst pain conditions that a patient can suffer and has been called the ""suicide disease"". Given the severity of this disorder, determining the cause becomes essential for finding a cure. This project will study the cause of TN using a translational approach, which means the research project will be completed in both humans and animals. The investigators hypothesize that there are specific areas of the brain and spinal cord that will provide a ""signature"" center of activity. The study team will use state of the art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines and other non-invasive brain activity measurements, including electroencephalography (EEG) to locate these centers in people with TN before and after their pain has started. Recent studies have investigated the effects of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) for pain control. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) includes transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).

The natural course of MDD tends to worsen without treatment, while people with MDD can lead healthy and productive lives when the illness is effectively treated. Up to 50% of the patients show no response to current available antidepressants.Two major non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) tools have been applied for the treatment of psychiatric diseases so far, transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation (TMS, tDCS). TMS induces a strong magnetic field (magnetic pulses) through the skull into the brain, which generates electrical currents in brain tissue and induces neuronal firing, leading to after-effects, i.e. neuroplasticity, eventually. Neuronal effects of rTMS has been proven to last beyond the actual time of stimulation, enabling altered brain activity for an extended period of time. Adding on rTMS treatment could even give a chance to treat the physical comorbidities and enhance cognitive function in MDD. Nevertheless, underlying neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment remains unclear. Reports showed chronic psychosocial stressors are associated with altered frontal-striatal circuitry activation and connectivity. Indeed, aberrant fronto-striatal connectivity and reduced sustain fronto-striatal activation were noticed in MDD patients. However, the specific correlations between fronto-striatal connectivity changes and rTMS treatment outcomes in MDD remain unclear. In this study fMRI will be used to measure the possible correlations between the fronto-striatal circuit activation / connectivity with (1) mood symptoms presentations, (2) neurocognitive measurements, (3) HPA and ANS activities, and (4) immune and metabolic status (cytokines, adipokines and insulin levels) in patients with MDD. Then the possible changes in fronto-striatal FC over a four-week treatment course with 10 Hz rTMS stimulation to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be measured. The FC changes will be tested to find out whether correlate with treatment outcomes, HPA and ANS activity; and immune/metabolic indices changes.||We hypothesize that rTMS as an add-on therapy would change the fronto-striatal FC that correlated with mood symptom improvement, neurocognitive measurements, HPA and ANS activity, inflammatory and metabolic homeostasis in patients with MDD.",No,No,"Disease|Depressive Disorder|Depression|Depressive Disorder, Major","Evaluation for disease severity by using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) by trained senior psychiatrists.

Absence of aspiration is not cause for exclusion if the risk for aspiration is deemed present due to impaired pharyngeal phase of swallowing as judged by an expert experienced in the evaluation of dysphagia. The patient may demonstrate evidence of aspiration or the risk for aspiration on any consistency, perhaps secondary to pharyngeal retention. Aspiration is defined as passage of food, liquid, or secretions into the trachea below the level of the vocal folds. If the patient does not demonstrate either aspiration or a risk for aspiration in previous assessment or during preliminary studies, they will be excluded from participation.||Impaired pharyngeal phase of swallowing may be evidenced by pharyngeal delay, reduced hyolaryngeal elevation, reduced laryngeal closure, and reduced pharyngeal clearance of the bolus. Signs of pharyngeal delay include hesitation of the material in the vallecula at times with spill over into the pyriform sinuses. Normally the pharyngeal phase of swallowing should be less than 1 second from onset until the passage of the bolus into the posterior pharynx. Delay will be defined as the time from the entry of the head of the bolus into the oropharynx at the posterior tongue and the lower posterior edge of the angle of the mandible, to the beginning of elevation of the hyoid bone and larynx. Reduced hyolaryngeal elevation will be identified when the larynx is not protected and remains open to the bolus during a swallow on videoendoscopy. Reduced pharyngeal clearance will be seen during videoendoscopy when the bolus remains in the vallecula and/or pyriform sinuses.||Chronic dysphagia can occur as a result of stroke or other brain injury.

Recovery of arm and hand function after stroke is limited to about 50% of patients and full recovery is achieved in only 12% of stroke survivors by 6 months after stroke. Within the first 8-12 weeks post-stroke, a proportional recovery of 70%, corresponding to good recovery, may be achieved, but at later stages no major gain is observed with current therapy practices. Accordingly, there is a need to find new potential therapeutic tools to enhance post-stroke motor recovery. Rehabilitation supported by neuroplastic intervention is a new and pragmatic therapeutic approach in the treatment of stroke, giving way to a concept of 'recovery enhancers'.||The objective of this study is to assess whether an additional therapy with Cerebrolysin and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) increases the success of conventional rehabilitation therapy in subacute and chronic stroke patients with unexploited potential for functional recovery despite intact structural and functional pathways in the brain.||Hypothesis:||The hypothesis is that the combination of Cerebrolysin and atDCS facilitates motor learning in subacute and chronic stroke patients. Accordingly, motor function recovery at day 21 post-baseline is expected to be higher in the verum group (conventional rehabilitation + task-specific motor training + Cerebrolysin + atDCS) as compared to the control group (conventional rehabilitation + task-specific motor training + placebo + sham-transcranial direct current stimulation).||The primary objective is to show a significantly higher proportional recovery rate in the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) at day 21 post-baseline in the verum group as compared to the control group.||The secondary objective is to assess the impact of this neuroplastic intervention on finger dexterity (Nine-hole peg test - 9HPT), hand grip strength, and neurological deficits (National Institutes of Healths Stroke Scale - NIHSS) at the end of therapy (day 21 post-baseline). Safety data are collected throughout the study and thereafter in case of ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) at study endpoint.||Optional secondary parameters include electroencephalography (EEG) parameters and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) status analyses to document plastic changes in the brain, in particular changes of the cortical network functionality during neurorehabilitation, and to assess the impact of neuroplastic intervention on the BDNF synthesis rate as well as the influence of different BDNF polymorphisms.",No,No,Stroke,"The ARAT assesses upper limb functioning.

The total score on the ARAT ranges from 0 to 57, with the lowest score indicating that no movements can be performed, and the upper score indicating normal performance.","The NHPT is used to measure finger dexterity. The NHPT is composed of a square board with 9 pegs. At one end of the board are holes for the pegs to fit in to, and at the other end is a shallow round dish to store the pegs. The NHPT is administered by asking the patient to take the pegs from a container, one by one, and placing them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible.

They can cause falls and are therefore associated with the negative spiral of (near) falls, fear of falling, fractures, reduced mobility and social isolation; hence, having a profound negative impact on quality of life (Lin et al. 2012). Originally, symptoms of PD were ascribed to dopamine deficiency and basal ganglia dysfunction (Wu et al. 2013). However, in the last decades it has become clear that other brain structures are also involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Snijders et al. 2011; Stefani et al. 2007). An intriguing, emerging insight is that the cerebellum may be involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Wu et al. 2013). That is, the cerebellum is hyperactive in PD patients during different motor tasks (Yu et al. 2007; Hanakawa et al. 1999; del Olmo et al. 2006). However, whether cerebellar hyperactivity is pathological or compensatory and how it affects gait and balance in PD patients remain open questions.

PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Each of these areas are assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe and 4 = very severe, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). A higher score indicates more severe disease.

DAPSA scores 0-4 = remission, 5-14 = low disease activity, 15-28 = moderate disease activity, and >28 = high disease activity. The DAPSA score has a lower bound of 0 and has no upper bound. A higher DAPSA score indicated more active disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.|The PhGAP is used to determine the participant's psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. The participant's psoriasis disease activity is assessed by a physician according to the grades of induration, erythema, and scaling on a scale of 0 to 5. The sum of the three grades is used to obtain the total average score. PhGAP is based on the total average score on a scale of 0-5 where, 0 = cleared, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked, and 5 = severe. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.|mNAPSI is used to assess each nail abnormality for each of the participant's nails. Three features or groups of features (pitting, onycholysis together with oil-drop dyschromia, and crumbling) of each fingernail are graded on a scale from 0 (no onycholysis together with oil-drop dyschromia, no pitting, no crumbling) to 3 (>30 onycholysis together with oil-drop dyschromia, >50 pitting, >50% crumbling). Four features (leukonychia, splinter, hemorrhages, hyperkeratosis, and red spots in the lunula) are graded with the score of 1 = present or 0 = absent for each fingernail. Each finger has a score between 0 and 13. The total mNAPSI score is the sum of all abnormalities individual score across all fingers, and the total mNAPSI score ranges from 0 to 130. Lower numbers indicate fewer nail abnormalities. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.|Enthesitis is assessed using LEI. The enthesitis examination by LEI evaluates the presence or absence of pain by applying local pressure on 6 anatomical sites: medial femoral condyle (left and right), lateral epicondyle (left and right), and the achilles tendon insertion (left and right). Enthesitis at each site is scored as 0 (enthesitis absent) and 1 (enthesitis present). LEI is derived as the sum of the enthesitis score over the 6 sites mentioned above. The total score ranges from 0 to 6, higher scores indicates greater degree of enthesitis. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.|The PsAID questionnaire assesses the impact of PsA on people's lives. The PsAID is calculated based on 12 numerical rating scales (NRS) questions. Each NRS is assessed as a number between 0 and 10. Total score is calculated as the sum of the individual scores, (some of which were multiplied by a weighting factor) divided by 20 for a total possible score of 0 to 10, where higher score indicates worse impact of disease.

Enthesitis at each site is scored as either 0 (enthesitis absent) and 1 (enthesitis present). SPARCC enthesitis index has an overall total score ranging from 0 to 16. Higher score indicates a greater number of sites that are affected by enthesitis. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.|LDI quantitatively measures dactylitis using the circumference of involved digits and control digits and tenderness of involved digits. Digits affected by dactylitis are defined as those with an at least 10% difference in the ratio of circumference of the affected digit to the contralateral digit (digit on opposite hand or foot), or if contralateral digit is also affected, values from a standard reference table. Total score= {{[Circumference involved digit/ Circumference contralateral Digit (or Tables)] - 1}x 100} x Tenderness score. Tenderness score (0 = no tenderness, and 1 = tender). The difference between circumference of affected finger and contralateral not affected digit cannot be defined for maximum value. Therefore, it is difficult to provide scale range for the final score. No theoretical range exists for the Leeds Dactylitis Index. Lower Leeds Dactylitis Index score represent better outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.|Tender score (0 = no tenderness, 1 = tender, 2 = tender and wince, 3 = tender and withdraw) is collected for Dactylitis Assessments on the Dactylitis Score Sheet that is used for calculation of LDI total score. Tender dactylitis count (TDC) equals the number of tender fingers and toes (tendor score >0). For participants with dactylitis status absent for all the fingers and toes, the TDC is set as 0. The total score range of TDC is from 0 to 60, higher scores indicate greater presence of dactylitis. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.|The HAQ-DI score is defined as the average of the scores of eight functional categories (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities), usually completed by the participant. Responses in each functional category are collected as 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do a task in that area), with or without aids or devices. The eight category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI score on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). When 6 or more categories are non-missing, total possible score is 3. If more than 2 categories are missing, the HAQ-DI score is set to missing. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement (less disability).|FACIT-Fatigue scale is a brief, 13-item, symptom-specific questionnaire that specifically assesses the self-reported severity of fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and functioning in the past 7 days.

In conjunction with the new developments, breast cancer survival has increased therefore the management of long-term complications has gained importance. Breast cancer survivors can face the loss of muscle strength, increased fatigue and diminished physical function associated with treatment-related long term effects and psychological affection and thereby reduced quality of life. Upper extremity lymphedema or breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is one of the most prominent long term complications which affects breast cancer survivors in many ways after breast cancer surgery. It has been reported that breast cancer survivors with BCRL have the lower muscle strength and more activity limitations when compared to the ones free of BCRL. In BCRL, affected extremity has been found to 36% more weaker when compared to the unaffected side. Fatigue is one of the most prominent symptoms when considering cancer-related symptoms in cancer survivors. It has been stated that increased fatigue is correlated with increased activity limitation and deterioration in physical function. The hand-grip test which is frequently used in the assessment of decreased muscle function has been stated as a reliable and repeatable test in breast cancer survivors. In addition, this test is frequently applicable to assess mortality, physical and functional capacity, symptoms after surgery and to designate an exercise program. There are studies that investigate upper extremity function associated with hang-grip strength in breast cancer survivors. Yet, there is a lack of the objective result or conclusion of the BCRL effect on upper extremity function which is assessed with hang-grip strength when compared without BCRL.

This scale provides a single, overall rating from 1 to 100, where a higher score represents better personal and social function.|The SRG-PSP is a self-rating scale of proven validity and reliability, comprising both male and female versions of cartoon-like pictures that are derived from the narrative text of the four domains of Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale including the sub-items of socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviour.|An expert-rating scale based on a patient interview to measure patients' clinical insight. The abbreviated version of SUMD comprises 9 items measuring current states of awareness as follows: (1) a mental disorder, (2) consequences of a mental disorder, (3) effects of drugs, (4) hallucinatory experiences, (5) delusional ideas, (6) disorganized thoughts, (7) blunted affect, (8) anhedonia, and (9) lack of sociability. Scores on each item range from 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates 'not applicable'; 1, 'aware'; 2, 'somewhat aware/unaware' and 3, 'severely unaware.' Based on the 3 dimensions approach of the abbreviated version of SUMD, the scores on the items 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 were averaged to obtain the dimension score of 'awareness of the disease', 'awareness of positive symptoms', and 'awareness of negative symptoms', respectively. All dimension scores were linearized on a 0-100 scale, with 0 and 100 indicating the lowest and highest level of unawareness, respectively.|Cognitive insight was measured by the Taiwanese version of the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS), a self-reported instrument comprising 15 items.The Taiwanese BCIS is composed of 2 subscales including reflective attitude (9 items) and certain attitude (6 items). We obtained a R-C (reflective attitude minus certain attitude) index of the Taiwanese BCIS, representing the measurement of cognitive insight by subtracting the score of the certain attitude subscale from that of the reflective attitude subscale. Lower R-C index scores indicate poorer cognitive insight.|The Taiwanese version of the Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire (SAIQ) was used to assess attitudes toward mental illness and experience of psychiatric treatment.This self-administered tool was composed of 17 items. The patients rated the extent to which they agreed with each statement of the item by using a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1, ''do not agree at all'', to 4, ''completely agree''. Whether the scale score is in order from least to most or from the most to least depends on the content of the item statement. The total score of SAIQ ranges from 17 to 68.|The Chinese version of the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale Revision Four is a self-administered questionnaire of 33 items in two domains: psychosocial and vitality.

SCWT is composed of three parts, each lasting for 45 seconds.|In the dual 2-back task, squares at 8 different locations will show up sequentially (stimulus length, 500 ms; inter-stimulus interval, 2,500 ms) on a computer screen every 3 seconds. Simultaneously with the presentation of the squares, one of eight consonants will show up sequentially through a speaker. Participants will have to judge whether the location of a square and the consonant they heard matches the one 2-back before (the same for both visual and auditory targets). Each experimental condition was presented with 100+n trials, resulting in a task time of 5 min. Each task includes 30 auditory and 30 visual targets (four appearing in only one modality, and two appearing in both modalities simultaneously) whose locations are random. Participants will have to make responses manually by pressing the mouse left-click button for visual targets and the right-click button for auditory targets. No responses were required for non-targets.|HRV indices represent autonomic functioning. ECG electrodes were placed on bilateral arms just below the elbows, with a ground electrode placed just above the right wrist bone. Lead I electrocardiogram of each patient was taken for 5 min after sitting and having a rest for 20 min in a soundproof, dim-lighted room with thermostatic control. At the four timepoints (baseline, after 10-session tACS, at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups), HRV will be collected during resting and during a dual 2-back task. The ECG signals were acquired, stored, pre-processed according to the recommended procedures and processed by an HRV analyser (LR8Z11, Yangyin Corp., Taipei, Taiwan). The time domain of HRV is obtained: Standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). Power spectrum of HRV is quantified into the standard frequency-domain measurements including low-frequency power (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz).|In a recliner in a dimly lit, electrically shielded room, patients' EEGs were recorded at 4 timepoints (baseline, after 10-session tACS, at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups) by using the Neuro Prax® TMS/tDCS full-band DC-EEG system with 32 EEG Ag/AgCl electrodes in the standard 10-20 International placement.
