Onset is usually in late adulthood at age 50 or older. Usually, synucleinopathies present clinically with slowness of movement, coordination difficulties or mild cognitive impairment. Development of these features indicates that abnormal alpha-synuclein deposits have destroyed key areas of the brain involved in the control of movement or cognition. Patients with synucleinopathies and signs of CNS-deficits are frequently diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA).||However, accumulation of alpha-synuclein and death of nerve cells can also begin outside the brain in the autonomic nerves. In such cases, syncucleinopathies present first with symptoms of autonomic impairment (unexplained constipation, urinary difficulties, and sexual dysfunction). In rare cases, hypotension on standing (a disorder known as orthostatic hypotension) may be the only clinical finding. This ""pre-motor"" autonomic stage suggests that the disease process may not yet have spread to the brain.||After a variable period of time, but usually within 5-years, most patients with abnormally low blood pressure on standing develop cognitive or motor abnormalities. This stepwise evolution indicates that the disease spreads from the body to the brain. Another indication of this spread is that acting out dreams (i.e., REM sleep behavior disorder, RBD) a problem that occurs when the lower part of the brain is affected, may also be the first noticeable sign of Parkinson disease.||The purpose of this study is to document the clinical features and biological markers of patients with synucleinopathies and better understand how these disorders evolve over time. The study will involve following patients diagnosed with a synucleinopathy (PD/DLB and MSA) and those believed to be in the ""pre-motor"" stage (with isolated autonomic impairment and/or RBD). Through a careful series of follow-up visits to participating Centers, we will focus on finding biological clues that predict which patients will develop motor/cognitive problems and which ones have the resilience to keep the disease at bay preventing spread to the brain.

It is still unclear whether, in addition to the increased brain expression and function of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain containing type 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome platform, a systemic activation of such complex might participate in the pathogenesis of PD, which could be the role of the P2X7R in this scenario, and whether such patterns undergo any specific epigenetic regulation.

The investigators showed in the laboratory in a pilot study that PD patients have digestive inflammation and that the level of inflammation was inversely related to the length of the disease course. This digestive inflammation could be at the origin of an increased intestinal permeability in a subpopulation of parkinsonian patients, cause or consequence of modifications of the intestinal microbiota, thus offering a potential portal of entry for a pathogen according to Braak's theory. To opponents of this theory, it could also reflect the spread of inflammation from the Central nervous System to the Enteral Nervous System (ENS), via the brain-gut axis.||Investigators' hypothesis is that digestive inflammation occurs very early in Parkinson's disease and that it is associated with hyperpermeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier and a change in the intestinal microbiota composition.

There are significant differences in incidence depending on geographical location, race, and ethnicity. The exact cause of the disease is still unknown, but the role of genetic and environmental factors has already been established. Certain genetic forms of the disease make up for a small percentage, so it is thought that environmental factors have a more significant impact on the development of the disease. The incidence of PD is higher in people exposed to significant quantities of pesticides and traumatic brain injury, while there is a smaller incidence in smokers and people consuming more significant quantities of caffeine. The project will finish in four years, with the first 20 months dedicated to the first phase (genetic-epidemiological research), and the entirety of the 48 months for the second phase of the project (prospective clinical research).||The main goal of the first phase of the project is to determine which genetic mutations are the ones most represented in the Croatian population afflicted with the familial form of PD. In the second phase the main goal is to determine the influence of genetic factors and microbiological factors on the disease's progression as well as on the treatment outcomes. Specific goals of this part of the project are to determine how many patients in the general population of PD patients present with a genetic disorder and which genes have a role in that disorder, as well as determine the composition of intestinal and oral microbiota both in the patient test group and the healthy control group. Furthermore, specific goals are to evaluate the effects of standard PD treatment on the composition of microbiota, neurodegeneration progression and the activity of neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and to examine whether there is a link between the physiological and the pathophysiological function of microbiota, using markers of disease progression and glial activity. Last specific goal is to analyze potential pathological conformation protein forms that could be used as a biomarker in early stages of the disease and a biomarker of disease progression.||The first phase of the study will provide the first epidemiologic data on the familial form of PD, as well as the mutations most represented in patients with PD in Croatia. Additionally, the prospective clinical study will contribute to enlightening the intertwined effects of genetic and environmental factors in the emergence and progression of the disease, as well as their effect on treatment outcome. Intestinal and oral microbiota composition analysis will determine whether there is a difference between PD and the healthy population while using the short-chain fatty acid profile will determine the metabolic differences between the two groups. Analyzing the markers of CNS homeostasis, inflammation, and neuroglial function will determine the progression of the disease and also correlate them to genetic factors as well as the microbiota function and composition.

Although most PD patients are sporadic, it is now clear that genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Indeed, LRRK2 G2019S mutation is one of the most common causes of familial PD. The phenotype corresponding to this mutation is a late-onset form of PD characterized by the accumulation of the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) in neurons. It is due to a dysfunction of the physiological autophagy processes occurring at cellular level, mainly affecting autophagy mediated by chaperone proteins (Chaperon Mediated Autophagy, CMA), responsible for the clearance of alpha synuclein at the lysosomal level. This condition, although sensitive to treatment with L-DOPA and dopamine agonists, does not currently have any specific therapy.||Recently, in a mouse model carrying the LRRK2 mutation, it has been demonstrated that treatment with trehalose is able to reduce the accumulation of NSF deposits in neurons of various brain areas such as the substantia nigra, striatum, cortex and hippocampus. The reduction of protein aggregates correlates with intracellular molecules related to the activation of apoptotic processes in damaged neurons. Moreover, it has been found a significant improvement in motor and cognitive performance. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of trehalose in two groups of patients affected by idiopathic PD and PD carrying the LRRK2 mutation, respectively. Moreover, the investigators will collect preliminary data on the effect that this molecule potentially has on disease course in both groups. The treatment duration will be 24 weeks and the overall study duration approximately 12 months. The populations observed will be composed of subjects affected by idiopathic PD and familial PD carrying the genetically confirmed LRRK2 mutation.

No potent symptomatic treatment is currently available. A disease-modifying therapy does not exist either. The growing understanding in recent years of the underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease allows the development of new treatment options that have a modifying effect on the disease progression. Therefore, treatments are urgently required that effect the central underlying pathological mechanism, which appears to be the intracellular aggregation of toxic oligomers of α-synuclein.||EGCG, a polyphenol found in green tea, has shown to inhibit the formation of toxic α-synuclein oligomers in vitro and has shown to transform α-synuclein-oligomers in non-toxic oligomer species. There is also evidence for a neuroprotective effect in MPTP-mouse models of PD and is an antioxidant and iron chelator. There are currently 63 clinical studies (http://clinicaltrial.gov) in which EGCG was applied for various indications, such as Multiple Sclerosis, various forms of cancer and Huntington's disease. All of which have shown good tolerability and safety with the applied doses of EGCG of up to 1200 mg per day, demonstrating the safety of the drug under controlled clinical conditions (see 5.3.1 for hepatotoxicity in uncontrolled conditions).||These data provide a solid rationale for testing in a clinical trial if supplementation of EGCG can interfere with the core disease mechanism in MSA and consequently retard the clinical progression of the MSA-related disability.",,,53,,,"To assess the efficacy of EGCG vs. Placebo to reduce the progression in the motor examination (ME) of the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS-ME) from V1 to V7, (80% power, 5% P-level, 50% effect size, i.e. an expected mean yearly UMSARS-ME increase of 3.9 under verum treatment compared to 7.8 ± 6.8 (mean ± standard deviation) under Placebo-treatment.",52 weeks,"To assess the efficacy of EGCG vs. Placebo to reduce the progression from V1 to V7 in UMSARS total score|To assess the efficacy of EGCG vs. Placebo to reduce the progression from V1 to V7 in clinical global impression|To assess the efficacy of EGCG vs. Placebo to reduce the progression from V1 to V7 in global and regional cerebral atrophy (3D MP-RAGE MRI volumetry, 3D FLAIR)|To assess the efficacy of EGCG vs. Placebo to reduce the progression from V1 to V7 in global and regional cerebral iron deposition in pons and striatum (T2* MRI)|Clinical safety and tolerability of EGCG (physical and neurological examination, laboratory parameters, adverse events, vital signs, drop-out rates, survival rates and survival time)|To assess any effect of EGCG vs. Placebo on the evolution of the above mentioned parameters during the wash-out phase (from V6 to V7) to explore possible symptomatic effects.",52 weeks|52 weeks|52 weeks|52 weeks|48 weeks|4 weeks,"To assess the efficacy of EGCG vs. Placebo to reduce the progression from V1 to V7 in Albumine, total protein, ferritin, iron, transferrin",52 weeks,"Inclusion Criteria:||""clinical possible"" or ""clinical probable"" MSA (Gilman et al., Neurology, 2008 26;71:670-6)|Hoehn & Yahr stage I -

Participants (N=12) were randomized 1:1 to once daily oral dose of 150mg and 300mg Nilotinib for 6 months. The investigators data suggests that Nilotinib penetrates the brain and inhibits CSF Abelson (Abl) activity via reduction of phosphorylated Abl in agreement with pre-clinical data. Several studies suggest that CSF alpha-Synuclein and Abeta42 are decreased and CSF total Tau and p-Tau are increased in PD and DLB. The investigators data shows attenuation of loss of CSF alpha-Synuclein and Abeta40/42 with 300mg (50% of the CML dose) compared to 150mg Nilotinib after 6 months treatment. CSF homovanillic acid (HVA), which is a by-product of dopamine metabolism, is significantly increased; and CSF total Tau and p-Tau are significantly reduced (N=5, P<0.05) with 300mg Nilotinib between baseline and 6 months treatment. Despite the reduction of L-Dopa replacement therapies in our study, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UDPRS) I-IV scores improved with 150mg (3.5 points) and 300mg (11 points) from baseline to 6 months and worsened (13.7 points and 11.4 points) after 3 months withdrawal of 150mg and 300mg, respectively. Other non-motor functions e.g. constipation was resolved in all patients and cognition was also improved (3.5 points) using both the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) or the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog) between baseline and 6 months.

These AEs will be tracked over the course of the trial and reviewed by the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) at scheduled meetings and in real time. SAEs and AEs are known to be related to drug use at 800mg daily in cancer. A small safety trial using lower oral daily doses of 150 mg and 300 mg Nilotinib in 12 PD patients showed one cardiac SAE over a six-month treatment period. Based on preliminary clinical data, investigator's brochure (IB) and scheduled EKGs and lab tests, SAEs and AEs will be evaluated real-time and on case-by-case basis.|Prior studies from our group showed that Nilotinib treatment increases the CSF levels of HVA, suggesting alteration of dopamine level.

The diagnosis of PD is primarily based on clinical presentations while the pathology stage of a-synuclein containing Lewy body deposition has already advanced. In addition to PD, there is another group of patients presenting with parkinsonism features mixed with other neurodegenerative symptoms. Pathologically, patients with these PD-mimicking parkinsonism syndromes, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration disorders (CBGD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with/without parkinsonism, have 4 repeat paired helical filament forms of tau protein (4R PHF-tau) aggregations in the neurons. Patients with these tauopathy related parkinsonism-plus syndromes could initially present as PD symptoms but will have a more deliberating disease course and combine with other systems degeneration. These patients are often a substantial diagnostic challenge to clinicians. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop reliable imaging and biofluid biomarkers for differentiating patients with PD and variable parkinsonism-plus syndromes.||Recently, new generation of novel radiotracer 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607), which can be labeled with 4R PHF-tau without significant off-target binding, has been successfully developed.

An initial aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in the gut with subsequent propagation along the vagus nerve to the brain has also been hypothesised. Interestingly, in an α-syn overexpressing murine model, the absence of gut microbiota prevented both microglia activation and motor impairment, pointing to a fundamental role of the microbiota in the development of PD.

Synucleinopathy refers to a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein protein in the central nervous system (CNS). Common examples of synucleinopathy are Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Among all the premotor clinical markers that have been identified, a sleep disorder known as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with the highest likelihood ratio of developing PD. In addition, it has been shown that almost all RBD patients (over 80%) eventually developed neurodegenerative diseases after 14 years follow-up.||Gut microbiota and synucleinopathy In recent years, several key studies have advanced our understanding regarding the roles that brain-gut-microbiota axis plays in the pathogenesis of brain diseases, including PD. It has been shown that gut microbiota is implicated in a series of pathophysiological changes in PD, including motor deficits, microglia activation, and αSyn pathology in mice model with overexpression of αSyn. Furthermore, some microbiotas, such as enterobacteriaceae, have been shown to be positively associated with the severity of PD symptoms, including postural instability and gait difficulty.||Limitations in previous studies and knowledge gaps Nonetheless, the answers for several key questions regarding the roles of gut microbiota in the progression of synucleinopathy are still unclear. First, whether these microbiotas found in previous studies are the causes or the effects of PD. For example, medications treating PD may also affect the gut microbiome. Moreover, the microbiota may be affected by a number of factors commonly found in PD, such as constipation per se and diet. In this regard, an influential hypothesis of synucleinopahy was proposed by Braak et al at which the early premotor features including gastro-enterology symptoms, such as constipation and RBD would predate the onset of PD by some years. Thus, it is crucial to compare the microbiota among individuals at different stages of synucleinopathy. In view of slow progression of synucleinopathy and a relatively low prevalence of synucleinopathy in the general population, it is impractical to run a prospective study to examine this research question. Finally, gut microbiota is determined by both genetic and environmental factors.

This entities are still unknown on the clinical, genetic and metabolic "" au plan "".||Throughout a national network of 15 specialized centres in movement disorders, coordinated by the team of the neurogenetics reference centre at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (Alexis Brice), we propose to precise the relative frequency, the molecular bases and abnormalities in functional neuroimaging associated with the LRRK2 gene mutations, the most frequently implicated in the autosomal dominant forms. Due to the relative rarity of this parkinsonian syndrome, we will perform at the same time a retrospective study in cases and families already collected by the national network (300 isolated cases and 300 families) and a prospective study. The network will recruit 100 isolated cases and 40 familial cases yearly, with precise diagnosis tools. The genetic analysis will evaluate the relative frequency of the LRRK2 mutations and their spectrum in the French population. Phenotype-genotype correlations will be performed to better orientate the molecular diagnosis, in order to improve the genetic counselling and reduce costs of these analyses. In the case of LRRK2 mutations, a genetic investigation will be proposed to the families, with a specific care to at-risk cases. A detailed phenotypic evaluation of patients and at-risk cases will be proposed (neurological, neuropsychiatric and behavioural) at the CIC Pitié-Salpêtrière and also in imaging, for 15 patients and 40 of their relatives (20 carriers and 20 non-carriers of the LRRK2 mutation).
