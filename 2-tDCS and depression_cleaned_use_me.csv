They are particularly appealing since many patients are either refractory or present side effects to standard pharmacological regimens. TDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation). a novel non- pharmacological brain stimulation technique, might help in overcoming some of these issues, since it has low cost, high portability and it is relatively easy to use. TDCS consists in applying a weak, direct current through two electrodes placed over the scalp; the anode and the cathode increasing and decreasing cortical excitability during and beyond the period of stimulation. It is also a safe technique with only mild adverse effects described. Previous studies, some of them from our group, have described that tDCS is an effective technique for major depression.

Treatment is often challenging; an estimated 20-40% of patients do not benefit sufficiently from existing antidepressant interventions including trials of medication and psychotherapy. A 15-25% of patients manifest a chronic, treatment-resistant course of illness, resulting in a need for additional treatment options. Brain stimulation techniques are considered as a promising therapeutic approach in affective disorders like MDD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been largely investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed as novel treatment in MDD. In the largest 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial in MDD to date, Brunoni et al. (2013) have shown that tDCS combined with an Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) resulted in an antidepressant efficacy superior to placebo treatment, tDCS alone and sertraline alone.||The purpose of this study is to explore the sustained efficacy and tolerability of repeated tDCS for the treatment of MDD. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS in combination with an SSRI will provoke an antidepressant effect while antidepressant medication alone (sham tDCS) did not.

Therefore, the investigators aim to undertake this exploratory study.||Aim:||Compare the role of left prefrontal cortex anodal t-DCS daily stimulation of 4 weeks (20 week days) with sham stimulation in alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with TRD.||Methodology: Patients who seek treatment in our treatment resistant depression clinic and who have failed to respond to treatment with two antidepressant medications will be offered to enroll in this study. The aim is to study 20 patients who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD between the ages of 21-65 years. Those subjects that receive sham stimulation will be offered to have active t-DCS stimulation for additional 3 weeks to get any benefit that they may have otherwise missed by being in the sham stimulation group.||Results and Conclusions: The investigators will compare the mean baseline and end of treatment Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale between the two groups. The investigators will compare the change in mean depression scores between the baseline and end of treatment in those receiving active t-DCS for a total of 7 weeks duration. This study is innovative and of significance in exploring the role of this novel, easy to administer, safe and cost effective treatment modality.",No,No,"Depressive Disorder|Depressive Disorder, Major|Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant",Investigators will measure the changes in Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale scores with trans-cranial direct current stimulation,,3,Actual,,,,,Inclusion Criteria:||Subjects that meet criteria for Major depressive disorder (MDD)|ages 21 to 65 years and|who are treatment resistant||Exclusion Criteria:||Co-morbid substance abuse in last one month.|Psychotropic medication changes in last two weeks.|Unstable medical or psychiatric problems that need intensive outpatient or inpatient treatment|Patients who are not competent to consent for the study|Urine pregnancy test positive|Ferromagnetic Implanted devices that use electrical or magnetic currents,,No,,Gainesville,United States,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02141776"", ""NCT02141776"")"

The electrical current is generally completely imperceptible after initial period of tingling which takes about 30 seconds. Stimulation under the anode appears to increase brain activity where as stimulation under the cathode has the opposite effect. This research plan involves two clinical trials:||A study using tDCS to treat both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as lack of motivation and energy appear to arise due to a lack of activity in frontal brain areas. Positive symptoms such as hallucinations and confused thoughts may arise through over activity of brain areas more on the side and towards the back of the brain called the temporal cortex. We plan to apply tDCS such that it can simultaneously increased activity in these frontal brain areas and reduce activity over temporal cortex. We will compare active stimulation to a placebo condition which involves turning the stimulator off after 30 seconds. The capacity to target multiple symptom clusters is unique with this type of brain stimulation.|The study using tDCS in treatment resistant depression builds on a work with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS techniques in depression seem to work which increased left frontal brain activity or decrease right frontal brain activity. tDCS will be used to do the same thing with the anode used to increase left-sided brain activity and the cathode used to simultaneously decreased right-sided brain activity.||tDCS is potentially a better tolerated procedure than TMS and does not appear to have the same risk of seizure induction.

It can be associated with several neuropsychiatric complications, which include a broad spectrum of emotional distress and cognitive, results in important clinical implications for the prognosis of these patients. Depression is a common complication, affecting around 5-72% of patients and is associated with various cognitive deficits and also with increased mortality - up to 50% more deaths compared to non-depressed patients. Treatment of depression after stroke is important not only to improve depressive symptoms but can also be beneficial for cognitive deficits, activities of daily living. and leads to increased survival for these patients. There are different treatments for depression after stroke, all showing inconclusive results, even though antidepressants have been effective in some groups of patients, tolerability and treatment adherence were not very good-so it is necessary that new therapeutic modalities are presented with good tolerability. In this sense, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an interesting technique that can provide interesting results, which proved to be effective for depression in some studies. This study proposes to investigate the effect of tDCS for the treatment of major depressive disorder after stroke. The proposed design is a clinical trial, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in a subsample of participants in the prospective cohort of stroke: Study of Morbidity and Mortality of stroke. They will be allocated to one of the groups: sham or active tDCS group. Participants will receive ten consecutive days of active or sham stimulation and return at the end of two weeks to evaluate the improvement in depression, cognition and functionality.

These dysfunctions have been linked to a deficit in prefrontal cortex activity. The latter has an inhibitory influence on limbic regions -especially the amygdala- involved in the generation of emotions. By this means, the prefrontal cortex intervenes in the control of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system whp are responsible for the physiological components of the emotion, including the variations of the cardiac rhythm (HRV: heart rate variability).||In emotionally demanding situations, the activity of the prefrontal cortex is generally associated with an increase in parasympathetic activity that is exerted by stimulation of the vagus nerve. In patients with anxio-depressive disorder, there is a decrease in the activity of the autonomic nervous system whose variability in heart rate is a recognized marker.||Many studies show a beneficial impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) on anxio-depressive symptoms, particularly when a particular area is targeted: the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. The impacts of this intervention are multiple and aim in particular to modulate the activity of the autonomic nervous system to promote regulation.||Biofeedback HRV is a technique that allows you to learn how to modulate your heart rate by means of respiratory control exercises. The patient receives an immediate feedback on the effectiveness of his learning (basic principle of bio-feedback). This intervention will allow to act on the parasympathetic activity and to promote a vagal tone adequate to the emotional regulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the favorable impact of HRV biofeedback on the reduction of anxious and depressive symptoms.||Since the vagus nerve seems to be a primary pathway in physiologically emotional regulation, and considering that vagal tone can be stimulated by both the activity of the prefrontal cortex and through respiratory control, it appears interesting to study the association of t-DCS with HRV biofeedback techniques.||The first objective of this study is to show that HRV biofeedback training coupled with t-DCS is associated with a greater decrease in anxious symptomatology. The secondary objective of the study is to show that a coupling of these two techniques is associated with an increase of the variability of the cardiac rhythm as well as a more important decrease of the depressive symptomatology.",No,No,Depressive Disorder,"Questionnaire with 20 questions, each with 4 possible answers.

Cognitive symptoms, such as poor memory, concentration, and decision making, are associated with disability in many spheres of life, and these symptoms often persist even when antidepressant treatment improves other symptoms (mood, energy, sleep, anxiety).

However, despite continued advances in ECT technique, neurocognitive dysfunction continues to be a frequent adverse effect. Declarative memory and less so selective memory are often impaired after an ECT course. Immediate memory, however, is broadly preserved. It is hypothesized that memory impairments are due to ECT induced disruptions on long term potentiation as well as in cerebral flux and glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. Different pharmacological agents for the treatment of ECT induced cognitive dysfunction have been tried. Agents such as opioids, vasopressin, neuropeptides, cholinergic agents, thyroid hormone, and stimulants have been used with equivocal results, and no controlled studies showed clear efficacy.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation treatment that uses direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain. Electrical currents are applied constantly at low intensities (1-2 mA) over a long period, usually in minutes (5-30 minutes), to achieve changes in cortical excitability by influencing spontaneous neural activity. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation acts to excite neuronal activity while cathodal stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity. Several studies demonstrated moderate to strong effect sizes of tDCS in various neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric settings. Majority of studies show positive effects of tDCS on cognitive functioning among healthy volunteers and subjects with neurological or psychiatric conditions. Beneficial effects of online stimulation applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have been reported for working memory, attention and information processing in depressed patients.

The natural course of MDD tends to worsen without treatment, while people with MDD can lead healthy and productive lives when the illness is effectively treated. Up to 50% of the patients show no response to current available antidepressants.Two major non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) tools have been applied for the treatment of psychiatric diseases so far, transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation (TMS, tDCS). TMS induces a strong magnetic field (magnetic pulses) through the skull into the brain, which generates electrical currents in brain tissue and induces neuronal firing, leading to after-effects, i.e. neuroplasticity, eventually. Neuronal effects of rTMS has been proven to last beyond the actual time of stimulation, enabling altered brain activity for an extended period of time. Adding on rTMS treatment could even give a chance to treat the physical comorbidities and enhance cognitive function in MDD. Nevertheless, underlying neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment remains unclear. Reports showed chronic psychosocial stressors are associated with altered frontal-striatal circuitry activation and connectivity. Indeed, aberrant fronto-striatal connectivity and reduced sustain fronto-striatal activation were noticed in MDD patients. However, the specific correlations between fronto-striatal connectivity changes and rTMS treatment outcomes in MDD remain unclear. In this study fMRI will be used to measure the possible correlations between the fronto-striatal circuit activation / connectivity with (1) mood symptoms presentations, (2) neurocognitive measurements, (3) HPA and ANS activities, and (4) immune and metabolic status (cytokines, adipokines and insulin levels) in patients with MDD.

Breast cancer patients produce a mean FACT-Cog total score of 119.0 ± 23.3.The FACT-Cog takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.|Objective cognitive function from baseline (prior to tDCS) to completion of tDCS will be assessed. The measurement tool for objective cognitive function for this objective will be the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) of working memory. The PASAT is working memory task that has been well-validated medical populations including breast cancer. Test administration involves the aural presentation of single digits via computer in order to ensure a standardized rate of stimulus presentation. Stimuli are presented every three seconds (trial 1) or every two seconds (trial 2). Participants add each new digit to the one immediately prior as the test continues to present stimuli. The test score reflects the total number of correct sums given (out of 60 possible) in each trial. Two equivalent, alternative PASAT forms will be used to minimize practice effects. The test takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.|The measurement tool for QOL will be the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The impact of tDCS on QOL will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30. This 30-item questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social and cognitive), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain), a global health status scale and six single items (dyspnea, constipation, diarrhea, appetite, sleep and financial difficulty). The first 28 questions are answered using a Likert-like scale ranging from 1, ""not at all"", to 4, ""very much"". The last two questions are answered on a Likert-like scale ranging from 1, ""poor"" to 7, ""excellent"". The recall period is 7 days. The EORTC QLQ-C30 has been extensively used as a quality of life measure in breast cancer clinical trials and is well validated in the breast cancer population. The EORTC QLQ-C30 takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.",3,Actual,,,,"Daily subjective fatigue will be measured by the MD Anderson Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI will be completed daily from day 1 of stimulation until day 1 of the next chemotherapy cycle. Participants will be given multiple copies of the BFI with the date marked on them to complete at home. Participants will return the completed BFI at a follow-up visit or by mail. The BFI measures the severity of fatigue and the degree to which it interferes with function. The BFI has 9 items. The first 3 items rate fatigue severity and are measured on a scale of 0, ""no fatigue"", to 10, fatigue ""as bad as you can imagine."" The remaining items rate interference of fatigue and are measured on a scale of 0, ""does not interfere"" to 10, ""completely interferes."" The recall period for the BFI is 24 hours. The BFI has been validated in patients with solid tumors including breast cancer and in patients receiving chemotherapy. The BFI takes only a few minutes to complete.|Patient-Reported Side effects of tDCS will be assessed by a side effects questionnaire. This will include questions regarding physical sensations and mood experienced prior to and following each stimulation session (i.e. twice during all five sessions) to document the presence and severity of any tDCS-related side effects. Participants will be asked to rate the severity of these experiences and to report any other sensations they were not asked about directly. At the end of stimulation on the fifth day, each participant will also be asked whether he/she believes he/she was receiving active or sham tDCS as part of the side effects questionnaire and he/she will rate the degree of confidence with respect to these judgments. This questionnaire takes less than five minutes to complete.|The measurement tool for objective cognitive function for this objective will be the Trail Making Test (TMT). The TMT is composed of 2 parts (A and B). Part A is designed to evaluate visual motor scanning and processing speed. Part B is designed to evaluate processing speed and executive functioning. These tests require patients to connect circles in numerical (part A) or alternating numerical and alphabetical sequence (part B) as quickly as possible. Results are reported as the number of seconds required to complete each part, with higher scores reflecting higher degrees of impairment (range 0 - 300 seconds per trial). Normative data are available in the form of demographically adjusted T-scores. The task takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Clinical trials have repeatedly shown the TMT to be sensitive to the impact of cancer and treatment-related neurotoxicities. Breast cancer survivors have been shown to produce z-scores of 0.56 ± 1.29 on part A and 0.15 ± 1.22 on part B.|The measurement tools for objective cognitive function for this objective will be the Calibrated Ideational Fluency Assessment (CIFA). The CIFA verbal fluency trials are designed to evaluate verbal fluency and executive functioning. The task requires patients to name as many words as possible beginning with two different letters (letter fluency) and that belong to two different categories (category fluency) over four separate one-minute trials. The task takes approximately five minutes to complete. Scoring is based on the number of correct words produced over the course of the four trials, with greater values reflecting better performance. Normative data are available in the form of demographically adjusted T-scores.|Chemotherapy will be considered to be given on time if there is no more than 3 days delay (i.e. administered within 24 days of prior cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy). Timeliness of administration of chemotherapy after tDCS will be evaluated by chart review to determine if the next cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is administered within 24 days of the chemotherapy administered during study participation and prior to tDCS (i.e. no more than 3 day delay in a 21 day cycle). This endpoint will only be evaluated in participants for whom an additional cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is planned.|Available medical records will be reviewed in the electronic medical record to obtain information relative to factors which may impact the feasibility of tDCS and the effect of tDCS on fatigue, cognitive function and quality of life.

It affects around 15% of people in the UK. About 20% of people with tinnitus experience symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life including sleep disturbances, difficulties with hearing and concentration, social isolation, anxiety, depression, irritation or stress. Most common clinical management strategies for tinnitus include education and advice combined with some form of sound therapy. The effects of these management options are, however, variable. Currently, the exact aetiology of tinnitus is unknown although maladaptive plasticity due to sensorineural hearing loss is thought to play a big role. Neuroimaging studies have pointed to over-activation or excessive spontaneous activity within the central auditory cortex. Furthermore, electrophysiological techniques have confirmed the frontal cortex's role in tinnitus through dysfunctional top-down modulation.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neurostimulation technique in which weak currents (1-2 mA's) are delivered to the brain, thereby depolarising or hyperpolarising neurons within the desired region of cortex. tDCS is a non-invasive and easy to apply tool, delivered by applying two surface electrode to a patients head. It has previously been used as a treatment for depression, stroke rehabilitation, and cognitive enhancement.||Some studies have indicated potential benefit of tDCS in tinnitus patients, but this has not yet been investigated within the UK. Neuromodulation therapies should deliver a permanent reduction in tinnitus percept by driving the neuroplastic changes necessary to interrupt abnormal levels of oscillatory cortical activity and restore typical levels of activity. This change in activity should alter or interrupt the tinnitus percept (reduce or extinguish) and this should be concomitant with a change in the level of self-reported tinnitus handicap. The currently ongoing Cochrane review of neuromodulation (desynchronisation) for tinnitus in adults found mixed evidence for the electrical stimulation therapies for tinnitus, including tDCS. However, the review also found that the most recent tDCS trials that have used greater numbers of treatment sessions found significant reductions in tinnitus symptom severity, anxiety, and depression. Authors concluded that these findings warrant further trials of tDCS. Research studies using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggested changes in oscillatory activity in different frequency bands that might be associated with tinnitus, however a consistent picture has not yet emerged. Reduction of this abnormal activity might signify a reduction in the level or perceived severity of TI and could potentially be used as a valuable indicator of the course of TI treatment.||In this project specific changes in brain activity that happen during a new treatment approach for tinnitus - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)- will be investigated.

During this period, and after the establishment of Menopause and non-functioning ovarian, the appearance of various symptoms that express the depletion of ovarian follicles is common; among these symptoms, the most frequently reported by women are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes. In addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The rationale for studying the effect of this technique in this context is its possible autonomic modulatory effect. What reinforces the choice of this technique is the fact that it demonstrated efficacy in other pathologies such as depression, pain, Parkinson's disease, among others.

Then, five main symptom dimension subscales of PANSS can be calculated from 26 of 30 items of PANSS: positive (5 items, score 5-35) , negative (8 items, score 8-56), grandiosity/excitement (4 items, score 4-28), disorganization (5 items, score 5-35), and depression (4 items, score 4-28).","A clinician-administered rating scale to measure the psychosocial functioning of the patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The PSP scale measures psychosocial functioning within four domains: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior.The patient is rated from 1 to 6 on each item of the four domains. A higher score indicates greater psychosocial functioning in any of the four domains. The final global score is defined according to a summary instruction table. This scale provides a single, overall rating from 1 to 100, where a higher score represents better personal and social function.|GAF is a numeric scale used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of an individual, e.g., how well one is meeting various problems-in-living. Scores range from 100 (extremely high functioning) to 1 (severely impaired). GAF serves as a valid tool of assessing global psychosocial and occupational functioning for schizophrenia patients.|Illness severity was assessed with the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scales. The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The patient is rated from 1 to 7 and a higher score indicates greater illness severity.|The SRG-PSP is a self-rating scale of proven validity and reliability, comprising both male and female versions of cartoon-like pictures that are derived from the narrative text of the four domains of Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale including the sub-items of socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviour.|An expert-rating scale based on a patient interview to measure patients' clinical insight. The abbreviated version of SUMD comprises 9 items measuring current states of awareness as follows: (1) a mental disorder, (2) consequences of a mental disorder, (3) effects of drugs, (4) hallucinatory experiences, (5) delusional ideas, (6) disorganized thoughts, (7) blunted affect, (8) anhedonia, and (9) lack of sociability. Scores on each item range from 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates 'not applicable'; 1, 'aware'; 2, 'somewhat aware/unaware' and 3, 'severely unaware.' Based on the 3 dimensions approach of the abbreviated version of SUMD, the scores on the items 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 were averaged to obtain the dimension score of 'awareness of the disease', 'awareness of positive symptoms', and 'awareness of negative symptoms', respectively. All dimension scores were linearized on a 0-100 scale, with 0 and 100 indicating the lowest and highest level of unawareness, respectively.|Cognitive insight was measured by the Taiwanese version of the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS), a self-reported instrument comprising 15 items.The Taiwanese BCIS is composed of 2 subscales including reflective attitude (9 items) and certain attitude (6 items). We obtained a R-C (reflective attitude minus certain attitude) index of the Taiwanese BCIS, representing the measurement of cognitive insight by subtracting the score of the certain attitude subscale from that of the reflective attitude subscale. Lower R-C index scores indicate poorer cognitive insight.|The Taiwanese version of the Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire (SAIQ) was used to assess attitudes toward mental illness and experience of psychiatric treatment.This self-administered tool was composed of 17 items. The patients rated the extent to which they agreed with each statement of the item by using a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1, ''do not agree at all'', to 4, ''completely agree''. Whether the scale score is in order from least to most or from the most to least depends on the content of the item statement. The total score of SAIQ ranges from 17 to 68. This translated SAIQ comprises a three-factor explanation. The three factors correspond to worry (score 7-28), the need for treatment (score 5-20), and presence/outcome (score 5-20) subscales. Higher SAIQ subscale scores indicate more awareness of mental illness.|The overall quality of life (QoL) and the specific domains of QoL was measured with the self-administered World Health Organization Questionnaire on Quality of Life: Short Form-Taiwan version (WHOQOL-BREF) which was developed by the WHO in 1998 and was adapted to Taiwan's culture. The WHOQOL-BREF is of well-established validity and reliability, containing 28 five-point Likert items that assessed general (two items) and four specific domains of QoL, including 7 items in physical health, 6 in psychological, 4 in social relationships, and 9 in environmental domains.

Modern theory-based language therapies (LT) with proved efficacy in chronic PSA are brief (weeks), intensive, and oriented to specific domains (e.g., anomia). However, in order to maximize therapeutic benefits, it becomes essential to implement complementary strategies that boost gains in language, communication and behaviour and also to identify predictors of treatment response (demographics, anatomical) that enable to customize interventions adjusting them to each profile (linguistic deficits, brain structure and connectivity). Our group has repeatedly shown that LT combined with cognitive enhancing drugs (CED) (e.g., Donepezil and Memantine) are safe and promote better outcomes that when these interventions are administered separately. Moreover, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are also emerging as a promising treatment option for chronic PSA. However, is still unknown whether or not treatments that combine several biological strategies aid to improve outcomes further. Brain changes induced by these interventions and the premorbid characteristic of a ""good responder"" are also unknown. The aims of this clinical trial are: (1) Study the efficacy of combined treatments in a sample of patients with chronic PSA (n = 40); (2) Document with multimodal neuroimaging the functional and connectivity changes (neuroplasticity) promoted by these interventions; and (3) Identify linguistic, cognitive and behavioural variables that may predict outcomes for each intervention.",No,No,Stroke|Aphasia,"To assess major clinical aspects of language function: information content, fluency, auditory comprehension, repetition and naming.||Changes from Baseline in Western Aphasia Battery scores at 8, 10 and 26 weeks.

It allows neural systems to adapt in response to environmental input and subserves the vital functions of learning and memory. Deficits in plasticity are also thought play a causal role in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia (SZ). Treatments that can probe or even enhance plasticity have potential to be of great clinical and research value. Non-invasive neuromodulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising method for modulating neural plasticity. tDCS delivers low-intensity direct current to cortical areas, thereby facilitating or inhibiting neural activity in a polarity specific manner. Due to its low cost and safety, tDCS has been employed in a wide variety of studies, but much remains unknown regarding its mechanism of action in humans. Experiments carried out in animal and tissue models indicate that tDCS modulates synaptic plasticity mechanisms of long term potentiation and depression (LTP/D), however, these findings have never been translated to human subjects, limiting the practical utility of the research. Recently developed electroencephalographic (EEG) based measures now allow the interrogation of synaptic plasticity non-invasively in humans, making it possible to explore the effects of tDCS on human brain plasticity.",No,Yes,Schizophrenia,The amplitude of the N100 component will be averaged across individuals in each group.

In patients with chronic pain, the anode is commonly placed over the motor cortex (M1) (Valeriani et al., 1999).",Not Applicable,2015-09-04,2017-05-01,2016-11-01,Completed,"Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of vulvodynia and despite its high prevalence and important sexual, conjugal and psychological deleterious repercussions, effective evidence-based interventions remain limited. For a high proportion of women, significant pain persists despite the currently available treatments. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) was shown to be effective in various chronic pain conditions. So far, only one case report study has shown significant pain reduction in women with vulvodynia. The main goal of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS in women with PVD compared to sham tDCS. Forty women diagnosed with PVD, by a gynecologist following a standardized protocol will be randomized to either active or sham tDCS for ten 20 minute sessions of 2 mA stimulation over a 2-week period. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, after treatment and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome is pain during intercourse assessed with a numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary measurements focus on sexual function, vestibular pain sensitivity, psychological distress, treatment satisfaction and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). The investigators expect that active tDCS treatment will significantly reduce pain during intercourse (post-treatment and 3-month follow-up compared to pre-treatment assessment). This trial will provide important information for determining the efficacy of a novel and promising intervention for women with PVD.",,,Vulvodynia|Vulvar Vestibulitis,"Pain during intercourse will be assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain at all, and 10 is the worst pain ever. This method for measuring pain has been shown to detect significant treatment effects in women with PVD and demonstrates a significant positive correlation with other pain intensity measures. Pain during intercourse is the main symptom of PVD and the one that most interferes with quality of life, hence the most relevant measure of functional outcome (Bergeron et al., 2008; Bergeron et al., 2001; Morin et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2011).","The McGill-Melzack questionnaire allows the assessment of sensory, affective and evaluative components of pain. This world-renowned questionnaire, studied for its validity, reliability and responsiveness to change, is commonly used in RCTs (Bergeron et al., 2001; Melzack, 1975; Davidoff et al., 1987; Hays et al., 1994; Bansal et al., 2009; Moy et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2010).|A gradual pressure (1 to 1000 g) will be applied to three distinct points of the vestibule at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions (Cyr et al., 2014). Each of these pressure points will be applied randomly (e.g. 3,6,9 or 3,9,6 or 6,9,3.). During this procedure, each participant will be asked to indicate when they start to feel pain (pain threshold) and subsequently the maximal pressure that can be tolerated (pain tolerance). Pain intensity is assessed throughout the test using a Computerized Visual analog scale (CoVas). This assessment has shown good reliability and validity (Cyr et al., 2014).|The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a multidimensional measure of sexual function evaluating desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. In addition to good psychometric properties (reliability, internal consistency and responsiveness to change (Rosen et al., 2000; Goldfinger et al, 2009), normative data are available for this questionnaire suggesting clinical level of dysfunctions (Wiegel et al., 2005).|Pain catastrophizing will be assessed using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan, Bishop, & Pivik, 1995), which consists of 13 items measuring exaggerated negative thoughts and feelings about the meaning of pain. Items are scored on a 5-point scale with the end points (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS is a reliable and valid measure that has demonstrated a stable factorial structure across clinical and general populations, including a French population (French et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2000; Sullivan, et al., 1995).|Anxiety will be assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI - (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970); ASTA - (Gauthier & Bouchard, 1993)). The STAI is a 40-item, well-known and widely used measure of state and trait anxiety that has demonstrated very good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha State = .93, Trait = .97) in various clinical and non-clinical samples including pain populations (Gauthier & Bouchard, 1993; Greenberg & Burns, 2003; Rule & Traver, 1983; Tanaka-Masumi & Kameoka, 1986).|Depression or depression symptoms will be measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI-II is comprised of 21 items, with scores for most items ranging from 0 (low intensity) to 3 (high intensity) (Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996; Beck, Steer & Garvin, 1988). This measure of depression has been validated for use in chronic pain populations (Turner & Romano, 1984).|The Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-20), evaluating fear of pain, also shows good psychometric properties (Coons, Hadjistavropoulos & Asmundson, 2004; McCracken & Dhingra, 2002).|Patient self-reported improvement [scale of 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)] and treatment satisfaction [scale of 0 (worse) to 10 (complete cure)] will be measured at the 2-week post-treatment and 3-month post-treatment structured interview in order to assess the clinical significance of results.|Sexual satisfaction will be assessed using the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction scale, which consists of 5 items assessing global sexual satisfaction.

Brain network stimulation will be carried out with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Target networks will be the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). Twenty AD and 20 bvFTD patients will be recruited and assessed with a comprehensive clinical, behavioral and cognitive battery, and 3 Tesla MRI scan (including resting-state functional MRI, arterial spin labeling, diffusion tensor imaging, structural MRI) at three time-points: baseline, after tDCS, and after 6 months. Patients will be randomized to 2 arms: anodal stimulation of the disease-specific network (DMN in AD, SN in bvFTD) or cathodal stimulation of the anti-correlated network (SN in AD, DMN in bvFTD). The intervention will consist of 10 tDCS sessions over two weeks. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected at baseline for biomarker's assessment; blood samples will be collected at each time-point to assess changes in peripheral inflammatory markers. Blood and CSF collection will be optional.

Each domain is based on a 5-point scale ranging from no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 to severe impairment=3. The global CDR score is computed via a memory-weighted averaging algorithm of the six domain scores and ranges from 0 to 5. The CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) is the sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate more clinical impairment. Negative changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement on the scale.|The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a behavioral scale administered to the caregiver assessing 12 dimensions: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor activity, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating. Each dimension has multiple screening questions relating to symptoms. If the answer to the screening questions is ""Yes"", the dimensional-score is the product of frequency (1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) and severity (1=Mild to 3=Severe) of symptoms. Dimensional-scores are summed (from 0 to 144). Higher scores indicate greater behavioral disturbances. Negative changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement on the scale.|The Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) is a 24-item inventory designed to assess behavior and personality changes via caregiver. Item-level scores range from 0=none, 1=mild/occasional, 2=moderate, 3=severe/most of the time. Item-scores are summed (from 0 to 72). Higher scores indicate greater behavioral/personality disturbances. Negative changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement on the scale.|Default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) mean functional connectivity is assessed on resting state functional MRI. Functional connectivity is standardized to Z scores and thresholded at Z>2. Higher values denote greater functional connectivity. A positive change at post tDCS compared to baseline represents an increase in resting-state functional connectivity.|Default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) mean cerebral blood flow is assessed on arterial spin labeling.
