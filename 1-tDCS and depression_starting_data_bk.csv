Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of prefrontal cortex regions has been reported to exert antidepressant effects. Treatment with tDCS for MDD requires sessions several times a week, which is very time-consuming and stressful for patients, as they have to come to the clinic almost every day. At the same time, the availability of non-drug therapies for MDD is limited, especially in more rural areas. The home-treatment approach with tDCS for MDD could address this problem and is of increasing interest in times of the Covid-19 pandemic, when frequent clinic visits should be avoided.||There are some studies on the home-treatment approach with tDCS for different, mainly neurological disorders such as parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and chronic pain. For the treatment of MDD with tDCS in the home treatment setting, only one pilot study has been published so far, which shows good feasibility and good antidepressant effects. However, this study does not include a placebo condition.||The study will be conducted in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design with 16 patients per group. Patients with MDD do a 6-weeks self-administered treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode: F3, cathode: F4, 5 sessions/week, 30min/day, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (parameters correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent stimulation) as adjunctive treatment to a serotonergic medication or alone. For the continuous monitoring of the technical parameters and thus for quality control and for blinding, the same technical achievements as in the DepressionDC trial are used. As a new feature, a cap is used for easier handling in the home-treatment setting, in which electrodes are already integrated at the F3 and F4 points.||This study aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of 6 weeks of daily home treatment with tDCS for MDD. According to the DepressionDC trial, the primary outcome parameters are the decrease in the MADRS after 6 weeks and at the end of the follow-up phase, as well as the feasibility based on the dropout rates and the outcome in the comfort rating questionnaire.

Treatment is often challenging; an estimated 20-40% of patients do not benefit sufficiently from existing antidepressant interventions including trials of medication and psychotherapy. A 15-25% of patients manifest a chronic, treatment-resistant course of illness, resulting in a need for additional treatment options. Brain stimulation techniques are considered as a promising therapeutic approach in affective disorders like MDD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been largely investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed as novel treatment in MDD. In the largest 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial in MDD to date, Brunoni et al. (2013) have shown that tDCS combined with an Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) resulted in an antidepressant efficacy superior to placebo treatment, tDCS alone and sertraline alone.||The purpose of this study is to explore the sustained efficacy and tolerability of repeated tDCS for the treatment of MDD. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS in combination with an SSRI will provoke an antidepressant effect while antidepressant medication alone (sham tDCS) did not. This will be measured by the change from baseline in the Montgomery Ãsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores after 6 weeks of treatment.||In this randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial (5 centers involved) patients with a diagnosis of MDD receive a 6-weeks treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode position F3, cathode over F4, 5 sessions/week for 4 weeks followed by 2 sessions/week for 2 weeks, 24 treatments in sum, 30min/day, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent stimulation), as adjunctive treatment with a SSRI.

Hence, combining home-based tDCS with eHealth systems to support data collection and teleHealth for remote health care has shown positive results in other neuropsychiatric disorders.||To uptake tDCS to PPD, further research is needed.

Though tDCS applied to prefrontal brain areas is shown to reduce symptoms in some people with major depressive disorder (MDD), the extent of antidepressant response often differs. Methods that map current flow directly in the brain while a person is receiving tDCS and that determine how functional neuroimaging signal changes after a series of tDCS sessions may help us understand how tDCS works, how it can be optimized, and if it can be used as an effective intervention for reducing depressive symptoms. We will investigate these questions in a two-part randomized double blind exploratory clinical trial.

The electrical current is generally completely imperceptible after initial period of tingling which takes about 30 seconds. Stimulation under the anode appears to increase brain activity where as stimulation under the cathode has the opposite effect. This research plan involves two clinical trials:||A study using tDCS to treat both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as lack of motivation and energy appear to arise due to a lack of activity in frontal brain areas. Positive symptoms such as hallucinations and confused thoughts may arise through over activity of brain areas more on the side and towards the back of the brain called the temporal cortex. We plan to apply tDCS such that it can simultaneously increased activity in these frontal brain areas and reduce activity over temporal cortex. We will compare active stimulation to a placebo condition which involves turning the stimulator off after 30 seconds. The capacity to target multiple symptom clusters is unique with this type of brain stimulation.|The study using tDCS in treatment resistant depression builds on a work with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS techniques in depression seem to work which increased left frontal brain activity or decrease right frontal brain activity. tDCS will be used to do the same thing with the anode used to increase left-sided brain activity and the cathode used to simultaneously decreased right-sided brain activity.||tDCS is potentially a better tolerated procedure than TMS and does not appear to have the same risk of seizure induction.

In recent years, trials have documented improvements in depressive symptoms using noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. Our aim in this research is to investigate the effects of brain stimulation combined with psychological therapy in depression, an area that remains largely unexplored. Specifically, stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region known to work inefficiently in depression, has been shown to result in an improvement of depressive symptoms, as well as in the patient's 'cognitive control' abilities. Because 'cognitive control' processes, such as concentrating and ignoring distracting thoughts, are engaged during psychological therapies for depression, we predict that DLPFC stimulation should improve how patients respond to psychological therapy.

A growing body of evidence indicates that repeated administration of prefrontal tDCS can ameliorate symptoms of depression. A main characteristic of depression is that patients show a bias towards processing negative relative to positive information. Previously, we have found that a single session of prefrontal tDCS applied during task performance increased learning rate for reward outcomes in healthy adults. Here, we will test whether stimulation induces a similar behavioural effect in individuals with subclinical depression. We will test the prediction that tDCS will increase learning rates for reward outcomes in a reinforcement learning task. The findings will contribute to understanding the cognitive effects of prefrontal tDCS in subclinical depression. The ultimate aim, to be explored through further studies, is to understand and improve how tDCS might be used in the treatment of depressive disorders.",No,No,Depression,"In our previous study (Overman et al., 2021), model comparison showed that participants' behaviour on this task was best fit by a computational model combining: a Rescorla-Wagner learning rule with a Softmax function, including two separate learning rates for wins and losses; an inverse temperature parameter accounting for choice randomness; and a tendency parameter capturing a potential tendency to favour one shape over the other. Since the current study aims to replicate our previous findings, we will use the same model. The key hypothesis-driven variable of interest for analysis is the win learning rate.|In addition to the computational model, we will also use a non-computational measure, the percentage of ""win-driven choices"". This is calculated from trials in which the win and loss are both associated with the same shape (""neutral"" trials). What shape the participant chooses on the next trial will depend on whether s/he is more influenced by the current win or loss outcome. If the win outcome has a greater influence, the participant will choose the same shape again on the next trial. If the loss is more influential, the participant will avoid the current shape and instead choose the other shape. The proportion of ""win-driven choices"" is the proportion of trials in which participants choose the same shape on trial n+1 that was associated with both a win and a loss outcome on trial n. The key prediction is that this will be increased by online tDCS.","As an exploratory analysis, we will test whether bifrontal tDCS might improve participants' ability to adjust their learning rates to the volatility context. The two outcome measures will be the difference in learning rates between stable and volatile blocks, e.g. the difference in win and/or loss learning rates contrasted between the wins-volatile and losses-volatile blocks (i.e. Win delta LR = win learning rate in wins-volatile blocks minus win learning rate in losses-volatile blocks; Loss delta LR = loss learning rate in losses volatile blocks minus loss learning rate in wins volatile blocks).",80,Anticipated,,,,,Inclusion Criteria:||Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study|Participant has a score of >9 on Beck's Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)|Fluent English-speaking|Right-handed||Exclusion Criteria:||Currently taking psychoactive medications|Personal or family history of epileptic fits or seizures|Family history of extreme mood fluctuations or bipolar disorder|Currently pregnant or current likelihood of becoming pregnant|Significant suicidal ideation or depression requiring immediate clinical referral,,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,25730669|20434997|33350387|31515055|28893377|28976304|32101631|19164589,Oxford,United Kingdom,,,

In particular, comorbid depression and anxiety disorders are associated with more treatment resistance. Thus, there is a great need for novel, more targeted treatments. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel intervention that can be used to causally target neural excitability and plasticity in brain regions/circuits implicated in regulating mood and anxiety and emerging evidence suggests that it reduces threat sensitivity. Here the investigators propose to use tDCS to target threat sensitivity as a core symptom of anxious depression to determine if the investigators can engage the neural circuits that are treatment targets. Following the administration of a single dose of anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment, early changes in emotional processing have been observed in healthy people and clinical groups. Among patients, acute cognitive effects - such as a reduction in threat sensitivity - have been shown to predict response to drug and behavioral treatments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have confirmed hyperactive amygdala and/or hypoactive prefrontal activity in patients, indicating an imbalance of activity within this cortico-limbic circuit that sub-serves threat identification (amygdala) and top-down control (prefrontal). Specifically, treatments aiming to remediate prefrontal/ amygdala dysfunction could be a critical target in patients exhibiting these deficits. Several clinical trials have shown that administration of frontal cortex tDCS is a potentially effective treatment for MDD. However, underlying mechanisms of action are unclear. To meet this gap, the investigators propose an experimental medicine study (target identification and initial target engagement paths) where 120 volunteers with anxious MDD will be randomized to receive a single session of active or sham tDCS in a parallel design. Threat sensitivity will be measured using task and resting state fMRI and potentiated startle electrophysiology. Preliminary data suggest reductions in behavioral threat sensitivity from a single session of frontal tDCS. This was followed up with an fMRI study which found that a single session of active vs sham frontal tDCS reduced amygdala response to fearful faces whilst simultaneously increasing frontal attentional control signals. This provides evidence that modulating activity in the frontal cortex inhibits amygdala response to threat, highlighting a potential neural mechanism for the behavioral reduction in threat sensitivity. In addition, this offers initial mechanistic insights into the efficacy of tDCS in clinical trials for the treatment of MDD and anxiety disorders, suggesting that threat sensitivity may be a suitable cognitive target. The current proposal builds on this to establish acute effects of frontal tDCS on amygdala response to threat (primary aim), frontoparietal response to threat (secondary aim), startle response under threat (secondary aim), approach-avoidance-conflict (exploratory aim) and model-based learning (exploratory aim). The ultimate aim is to apply these multi-level acute findings to mechanistic clinical trials of tDCS, to test their prediction of treatment response (full model path) and improve patient outcomes.",No,No,Hypersensitivity|Depression|Depressive Disorder,"Preliminary findings show that frontal tDCS can reduce amygdala threat reactivity in high trait anxious females.

These dysfunctions have been linked to a deficit in prefrontal cortex activity. The latter has an inhibitory influence on limbic regions -especially the amygdala- involved in the generation of emotions. By this means, the prefrontal cortex intervenes in the control of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system whp are responsible for the physiological components of the emotion, including the variations of the cardiac rhythm (HRV: heart rate variability).||In emotionally demanding situations, the activity of the prefrontal cortex is generally associated with an increase in parasympathetic activity that is exerted by stimulation of the vagus nerve. In patients with anxio-depressive disorder, there is a decrease in the activity of the autonomic nervous system whose variability in heart rate is a recognized marker.||Many studies show a beneficial impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) on anxio-depressive symptoms, particularly when a particular area is targeted: the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. The impacts of this intervention are multiple and aim in particular to modulate the activity of the autonomic nervous system to promote regulation.||Biofeedback HRV is a technique that allows you to learn how to modulate your heart rate by means of respiratory control exercises. The patient receives an immediate feedback on the effectiveness of his learning (basic principle of bio-feedback). This intervention will allow to act on the parasympathetic activity and to promote a vagal tone adequate to the emotional regulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the favorable impact of HRV biofeedback on the reduction of anxious and depressive symptoms.||Since the vagus nerve seems to be a primary pathway in physiologically emotional regulation, and considering that vagal tone can be stimulated by both the activity of the prefrontal cortex and through respiratory control, it appears interesting to study the association of t-DCS with HRV biofeedback techniques.||The first objective of this study is to show that HRV biofeedback training coupled with t-DCS is associated with a greater decrease in anxious symptomatology. The secondary objective of the study is to show that a coupling of these two techniques is associated with an increase of the variability of the cardiac rhythm as well as a more important decrease of the depressive symptomatology.",No,No,Depressive Disorder,"Questionnaire with 20 questions, each with 4 possible answers.

Among others, deficient cognitive control over emotional distraction is a central characteristic of MDD (Ochsner & Gross 2005; Disner et al. 2011; Beck 2008). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked with this deficit (Dolcos & McCarthy 2006). Moreover, aberrant functional connectivity patterns have been found in MDD patients (Kaiser et al. 2015). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been largely investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed as novel treatment in MDD. In addition, it is increasingly investigated as treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia (SCZ) (Brunelin et al. 2012). So far, prefrontal tDCS has been shown to enhance cognitive control over emotional distraction in MDD patients (Wokenstein & Plewnia 2013). Also, tDCS-induced connectivity changes found in fMRI studies comparing resting-state networks configurations before and after prefrontal tDCS may reflect a state of enhanced alertness (Keeser, Meindl, et al., 2011; Park et al., 2013).||The aim of this study is to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of tDCS effects in patients with different psychiatric disorders for which tDCS is a possible intervention, in particular MDD and SCZ, as compared to healthy individuals. For this purpose, we determine the most promising protocol in from investigations in healthy volunteers and apply this protocol in the patient sample including age- and gender-matched controls. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is collected during the execution of a cognitive control task as well as during a resting-state condition together with application of real or sham tDCS inside the scanner. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS as compared to sham a) reduces distractibility by compensating for deficient DLPFC activity and b) enhances functional connectivity in networks associated with externally directed attention or cognitive engagement. Second, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is performed to measure concentrations of GABA and glutamate in target regions of tDCS. It is hypothesized that tDCS effects are mediated via modulation of the inhibitory/excitatory systems and GABA and glutamate are used as markers of these systems.||In this placebo-controlled study healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of MDD or SCZ receive a single treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode position F3, cathode over F4, 20 min, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent stimulation). We conduct resting-state and MRS measurements combined with application of tDCS in the fMRI scanner. Subsequently, participants perform the cognitive control task (in dependence of Plewnia, C., Schroeder, P. A., & Wolkenstein, L. (2015)) in the scanner.

However, despite continued advances in ECT technique, neurocognitive dysfunction continues to be a frequent adverse effect. Declarative memory and less so selective memory are often impaired after an ECT course. Immediate memory, however, is broadly preserved. It is hypothesized that memory impairments are due to ECT induced disruptions on long term potentiation as well as in cerebral flux and glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. Different pharmacological agents for the treatment of ECT induced cognitive dysfunction have been tried. Agents such as opioids, vasopressin, neuropeptides, cholinergic agents, thyroid hormone, and stimulants have been used with equivocal results, and no controlled studies showed clear efficacy.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation treatment that uses direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain. Electrical currents are applied constantly at low intensities (1-2 mA) over a long period, usually in minutes (5-30 minutes), to achieve changes in cortical excitability by influencing spontaneous neural activity. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation acts to excite neuronal activity while cathodal stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity. Several studies demonstrated moderate to strong effect sizes of tDCS in various neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric settings.

Despite a poor prognosis, no treatments have been validated to date.||The development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques has allowed the creation of treatments focused on dysfunctional brain regions associated with motor conversion disorder. Hypoactivation of prefrontal dorso-lateral cortex underlies the course of functional motor symptoms. Results of the HYCORE study conducted at NÃ®mes University Hospital (including 20 patients, clinicaltrial.gov NCT02329626) confirmed these results and related hypoactivation of PFDLC to persistent motor disability at 3 months and 6 months follow-up. Activation of the PFDLC could restore executive control and thus promote the recovery of motor symptoms.||However, in most repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) the primary motor areas were targeted and the clinical improvement was related to self-suggestion induced by the motor response produced.||Among the different techniques, transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a medical neuromodulation device that delivers a direct, low-intensity electric current to cortical areas, facilitating neuronal activity. Recently, PFDLC stimulation via tDCS has been used to treat several neuropsychiatric disorders and shown to be effective in depression.

However, tDCS is a relatively new clinical tool and more needs to be understood about its use. This study hopes to further the field of knowledge by examining how tDCS should be optimally used. Application of tDCS in clinical trials of depression is typically to the prefrontal cortex, but in this project, tDCS application will be to the motor cortex as it provides a more ready measure of excitability. Excitability will be measured using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the motor cortex and electromyography (EMG) recordings from peripheral muscles stimulated. Using a cross-over three-arm design this study aims to investigate whether daily tDCS administered in increasing intensity across sessions leads to greater and lasting effects on brain excitability than keeping the intensity at a same dose across the days and whether the excitatory effect could be enhanced with D-cycloserine, a medication known to prolong the excitatory effects of a single session of tDCS. This in turn will inform on how to optimize tDCS for therapeutic applications, e.g treatment of depression. The study hypothesis is that 5 sessions of tDCS with a dose of D-cycloserine given on the Monday and Thursday sessions will result in more sustained effect on motor cortex excitability than 5 sessions of tDCS alone.

NSSI is the deliberate attempt to harm oneself, most often through cutting or burning, without suicidal intent. NSSI is a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy often triggered by negative emotions, especially those involving feelings of rejection. tDCS is a low-cost, portable, well-tolerated, non-invasive form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain via electrodes. Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in treating an array of conditions, depending on electrode placement, including depression and chronic pain. tDCS may also facilitate adaptive emotion regulation; researchers have also successfully used tDCS to reduce negative emotions and aggressive responses to social rejection. The investigators therefore seek to explore tDCS as a potential treatment for NSSI. This pilot feasibility study seeks 1) to examine how at-home, self-administered tDCS is tolerated in a sample of individuals who engage in frequent NSSI; 2) to gather pilot data regarding changes in emotional and neural responses during a social task after a series of tDCS sessions in this clinical population of individuals who engage in NSSI; 3) to gather pilot data on the effects of tDCS on NSSI behaviors and urges.

The natural course of MDD tends to worsen without treatment, while people with MDD can lead healthy and productive lives when the illness is effectively treated. Up to 50% of the patients show no response to current available antidepressants.Two major non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) tools have been applied for the treatment of psychiatric diseases so far, transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation (TMS, tDCS). TMS induces a strong magnetic field (magnetic pulses) through the skull into the brain, which generates electrical currents in brain tissue and induces neuronal firing, leading to after-effects, i.e. neuroplasticity, eventually. Neuronal effects of rTMS has been proven to last beyond the actual time of stimulation, enabling altered brain activity for an extended period of time. Adding on rTMS treatment could even give a chance to treat the physical comorbidities and enhance cognitive function in MDD. Nevertheless, underlying neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment remains unclear. Reports showed chronic psychosocial stressors are associated with altered frontal-striatal circuitry activation and connectivity. Indeed, aberrant fronto-striatal connectivity and reduced sustain fronto-striatal activation were noticed in MDD patients. However, the specific correlations between fronto-striatal connectivity changes and rTMS treatment outcomes in MDD remain unclear. In this study fMRI will be used to measure the possible correlations between the fronto-striatal circuit activation / connectivity with (1) mood symptoms presentations, (2) neurocognitive measurements, (3) HPA and ANS activities, and (4) immune and metabolic status (cytokines, adipokines and insulin levels) in patients with MDD. Then the possible changes in fronto-striatal FC over a four-week treatment course with 10 Hz rTMS stimulation to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be measured. The FC changes will be tested to find out whether correlate with treatment outcomes, HPA and ANS activity; and immune/metabolic indices changes.||We hypothesize that rTMS as an add-on therapy would change the fronto-striatal FC that correlated with mood symptom improvement, neurocognitive measurements, HPA and ANS activity, inflammatory and metabolic homeostasis in patients with MDD.",No,No,"Disease|Depressive Disorder|Depression|Depressive Disorder, Major","Evaluation for disease severity by using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) by trained senior psychiatrists.

The MFSI-SF takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.|Participants will self-report measures of cognitive function at the beginning and end of the five-day intervention. The endpoint for subjective cognition will be scores on the FACT-Cog, a 37-item self-report measure. Responses are provided on 5-point Likert-like scales addressing the frequency with which each type of cognitive difficulty occurred from 0 (never) to 4 (several times a day) over the prior seven days. Two additional subscales address ""noticeability"" or comments from others regarding cognition and ""effect of perceived cognitive impairment on quality of life."" These are rated on 5-point Likert-like scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The total FACT-Cog score is obtained by summing the individual subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 148. Breast cancer patients produce a mean FACT-Cog total score of 119.0 Â± 23.3.The FACT-Cog takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.|Objective cognitive function from baseline (prior to tDCS) to completion of tDCS will be assessed. The measurement tool for objective cognitive function for this objective will be the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) of working memory. The PASAT is working memory task that has been well-validated medical populations including breast cancer. Test administration involves the aural presentation of single digits via computer in order to ensure a standardized rate of stimulus presentation. Stimuli are presented every three seconds (trial 1) or every two seconds (trial 2). Participants add each new digit to the one immediately prior as the test continues to present stimuli. The test score reflects the total number of correct sums given (out of 60 possible) in each trial. Two equivalent, alternative PASAT forms will be used to minimize practice effects. The test takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.|The measurement tool for QOL will be the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The impact of tDCS on QOL will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30. This 30-item questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social and cognitive), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain), a global health status scale and six single items (dyspnea, constipation, diarrhea, appetite, sleep and financial difficulty). The first 28 questions are answered using a Likert-like scale ranging from 1, ""not at all"", to 4, ""very much"". The last two questions are answered on a Likert-like scale ranging from 1, ""poor"" to 7, ""excellent"". The recall period is 7 days. The EORTC QLQ-C30 has been extensively used as a quality of life measure in breast cancer clinical trials and is well validated in the breast cancer population. The EORTC QLQ-C30 takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.",3,Actual,,,,"Daily subjective fatigue will be measured by the MD Anderson Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI will be completed daily from day 1 of stimulation until day 1 of the next chemotherapy cycle. Participants will be given multiple copies of the BFI with the date marked on them to complete at home. Participants will return the completed BFI at a follow-up visit or by mail. The BFI measures the severity of fatigue and the degree to which it interferes with function. The BFI has 9 items. The first 3 items rate fatigue severity and are measured on a scale of 0, ""no fatigue"", to 10, fatigue ""as bad as you can imagine."" The remaining items rate interference of fatigue and are measured on a scale of 0, ""does not interfere"" to 10, ""completely interferes."" The recall period for the BFI is 24 hours. The BFI has been validated in patients with solid tumors including breast cancer and in patients receiving chemotherapy. The BFI takes only a few minutes to complete.|Patient-Reported Side effects of tDCS will be assessed by a side effects questionnaire. This will include questions regarding physical sensations and mood experienced prior to and following each stimulation session (i.e. twice during all five sessions) to document the presence and severity of any tDCS-related side effects. Participants will be asked to rate the severity of these experiences and to report any other sensations they were not asked about directly. At the end of stimulation on the fifth day, each participant will also be asked whether he/she believes he/she was receiving active or sham tDCS as part of the side effects questionnaire and he/she will rate the degree of confidence with respect to these judgments. This questionnaire takes less than five minutes to complete.|The measurement tool for objective cognitive function for this objective will be the Trail Making Test (TMT). The TMT is composed of 2 parts (A and B). Part A is designed to evaluate visual motor scanning and processing speed. Part B is designed to evaluate processing speed and executive functioning. These tests require patients to connect circles in numerical (part A) or alternating numerical and alphabetical sequence (part B) as quickly as possible. Results are reported as the number of seconds required to complete each part, with higher scores reflecting higher degrees of impairment (range 0 - 300 seconds per trial). Normative data are available in the form of demographically adjusted T-scores. The task takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Clinical trials have repeatedly shown the TMT to be sensitive to the impact of cancer and treatment-related neurotoxicities. Breast cancer survivors have been shown to produce z-scores of 0.56 Â± 1.29 on part A and 0.15 Â± 1.22 on part B.|The measurement tools for objective cognitive function for this objective will be the Calibrated Ideational Fluency Assessment (CIFA). The CIFA verbal fluency trials are designed to evaluate verbal fluency and executive functioning. The task requires patients to name as many words as possible beginning with two different letters (letter fluency) and that belong to two different categories (category fluency) over four separate one-minute trials. The task takes approximately five minutes to complete. Scoring is based on the number of correct words produced over the course of the four trials, with greater values reflecting better performance. Normative data are available in the form of demographically adjusted T-scores.|Chemotherapy will be considered to be given on time if there is no more than 3 days delay (i.e. administered within 24 days of prior cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy). Timeliness of administration of chemotherapy after tDCS will be evaluated by chart review to determine if the next cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is administered within 24 days of the chemotherapy administered during study participation and prior to tDCS (i.e. no more than 3 day delay in a 21 day cycle). This endpoint will only be evaluated in participants for whom an additional cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is planned.|Available medical records will be reviewed in the electronic medical record to obtain information relative to factors which may impact the feasibility of tDCS and the effect of tDCS on fatigue, cognitive function and quality of life.

It affects around 15% of people in the UK. About 20% of people with tinnitus experience symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life including sleep disturbances, difficulties with hearing and concentration, social isolation, anxiety, depression, irritation or stress. Most common clinical management strategies for tinnitus include education and advice combined with some form of sound therapy. The effects of these management options are, however, variable. Currently, the exact aetiology of tinnitus is unknown although maladaptive plasticity due to sensorineural hearing loss is thought to play a big role. Neuroimaging studies have pointed to over-activation or excessive spontaneous activity within the central auditory cortex. Furthermore, electrophysiological techniques have confirmed the frontal cortex's role in tinnitus through dysfunctional top-down modulation.||Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neurostimulation technique in which weak currents (1-2 mA's) are delivered to the brain, thereby depolarising or hyperpolarising neurons within the desired region of cortex. tDCS is a non-invasive and easy to apply tool, delivered by applying two surface electrode to a patients head. It has previously been used as a treatment for depression, stroke rehabilitation, and cognitive enhancement.||Some studies have indicated potential benefit of tDCS in tinnitus patients, but this has not yet been investigated within the UK. Neuromodulation therapies should deliver a permanent reduction in tinnitus percept by driving the neuroplastic changes necessary to interrupt abnormal levels of oscillatory cortical activity and restore typical levels of activity. This change in activity should alter or interrupt the tinnitus percept (reduce or extinguish) and this should be concomitant with a change in the level of self-reported tinnitus handicap. The currently ongoing Cochrane review of neuromodulation (desynchronisation) for tinnitus in adults found mixed evidence for the electrical stimulation therapies for tinnitus, including tDCS. However, the review also found that the most recent tDCS trials that have used greater numbers of treatment sessions found significant reductions in tinnitus symptom severity, anxiety, and depression. Authors concluded that these findings warrant further trials of tDCS. Research studies using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggested changes in oscillatory activity in different frequency bands that might be associated with tinnitus, however a consistent picture has not yet emerged. Reduction of this abnormal activity might signify a reduction in the level or perceived severity of TI and could potentially be used as a valuable indicator of the course of TI treatment.||In this project specific changes in brain activity that happen during a new treatment approach for tinnitus - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)- will be investigated.

The symptoms of CD are disabling, disfiguring, painful, and have a strongly negative impact on quality of life, including social withdrawal and depression. At present, there is no treatment that has been shown to have long term benefit in CD.

In addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).

Modern theory-based language therapies (LT) with proved efficacy in chronic PSA are brief (weeks), intensive, and oriented to specific domains (e.g., anomia). However, in order to maximize therapeutic benefits, it becomes essential to implement complementary strategies that boost gains in language, communication and behaviour and also to identify predictors of treatment response (demographics, anatomical) that enable to customize interventions adjusting them to each profile (linguistic deficits, brain structure and connectivity). Our group has repeatedly shown that LT combined with cognitive enhancing drugs (CED) (e.g., Donepezil and Memantine) are safe and promote better outcomes that when these interventions are administered separately. Moreover, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are also emerging as a promising treatment option for chronic PSA. However, is still unknown whether or not treatments that combine several biological strategies aid to improve outcomes further.

This lack of engagement in 'goal-directed' physical activity stems from numerous interrelated factors including lack of motivation, depressed mood, and cognitive ""executive"" impairments that diminish one's ability to regulate behavior over time. Intriguingly, each of these factors has been linked to the function of brain networks that include the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive and safe means of modulating the excitability of specific brain regions and their connected neural networks. tDCS designed to facilitate the excitability of the left dlPFC has been shown to improve motivation, mood, and multiple aspects of executive function in healthy adults. The investigators thus hypothesize that tDCS holds promise to increase goal-directed physical activity in older adults. This project aims to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial on the feasibility and effects of a 2-week, 10-session tDCS intervention targeting the left dlPFC, combined with behavioral intervention aimed at increases daily physical activity, on physical activity over a two-month follow-up period, in relatively sedentary older adults without overt illness or disease.",No,Yes,,Number of steps per day,"Average speed of walking during 60 seconds of continuous walking at preferred speed|A common field test of mobility|A neuropsychological test of working memory|A neuropsychological test of executive function|Global cognitive function.

Aggression to the prefrontal cortex, caused by an external physical force, responsible for anatomical injury and/or functional impairment, causes cognitive deficits with important consequences for the individual affected by the trauma and their caregivers. Therefore, rehabilitation is of utmost importance. The increase in pre-frontal cortical activation through training, activity-dependent stimulation and neuroplasticity, especially in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is related to better performance in functional memory. In this context, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), intended to drive neuroplastic changes in the brain, has been widely used to bring benefits to the cognitive function of individuals affected by various neurological conditions, including TBI by promoting neuroplasticity for critically involved cortical areas in the performance of tasks, culminating in cognitive benefits. In addition, studies have shown greater benefits when the technique is combined with cognitive training. Therefore, the objective of this parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to investigate the effect of tDCS applied on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and virtual reality cognitive training alone or in association with tDCS on cognitive function of individuals with severe chronic TBI.",No,No,"Brain Injuries|Brain Injuries, Traumatic|Wounds and Injuries","Will be performed throughWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (Digit span, Letter-Number Sequencing and Arithmetic subtests).

Treatments that can probe or even enhance plasticity have potential to be of great clinical and research value. Non-invasive neuromodulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising method for modulating neural plasticity. tDCS delivers low-intensity direct current to cortical areas, thereby facilitating or inhibiting neural activity in a polarity specific manner. Due to its low cost and safety, tDCS has been employed in a wide variety of studies, but much remains unknown regarding its mechanism of action in humans. Experiments carried out in animal and tissue models indicate that tDCS modulates synaptic plasticity mechanisms of long term potentiation and depression (LTP/D), however, these findings have never been translated to human subjects, limiting the practical utility of the research. Recently developed electroencephalographic (EEG) based measures now allow the interrogation of synaptic plasticity non-invasively in humans, making it possible to explore the effects of tDCS on human brain plasticity.",No,Yes,Schizophrenia,The amplitude of the N100 component will be averaged across individuals in each group.

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) allows to stimulate superficial areas of brain using a weak electrical current. Preliminary data suggest that tDCS may reduce alcohol craving and consumption.||Objectives: The main outcome is to test if tDCS can reduce alcohol craving and use and to assess the changes in BDNF and pro-BDNF levels. Secondary outcomes are the assessment of other psychiatric dimensions (mood, behavioral and cognitive alterations) associated with prolonged alcohol use.||Eligibility: Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-65 who do have AUD (moderate to severe).||Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study with three phases: 1) a tDCS intensive treatment phase; 2) follow-up with weekly tDCS stimulation; 3) follow-up without tDCS stimulation.||Participants will be screened with:||Psychometric Scales|Medical history|Physical exam|Urine tests and breathalyzer|After being enrolled, baseline behavioral and laboratory data will be collected.

BDNF is a member of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family of neurotrophic growth factors. Low levels of peripheral BDNF and NGF have been reported in mood disorders and other psychopathological conditions with normalization after antidepressant treatment or mood stabilization. The increase in serum levels of BDNF seems to reflect the concomitant activation of BDNF synthesis that accompanies the neuronal remodeling triggered by the suspension of alcohol intake and suggests that the synthesis of BDNF may have a role in the long-term maintenance of alcohol abstention. BDNF measurements will be calculated in pg/ml|Pro-BDNF is the precursor of BDNF and it acts as a repository of mature BDNF and acts itself by inducing neuronal thinning.

In contrast, neurophysiologically guided treatments might provide an alternative avenue, since these can normalize brain alterations without side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) appears useful in the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine, probably because of its modifying and re-balancing influence on neuronal activity. Yet, to test for the efficacy of tDCS in a clinically acceptable way, it is necessary to apply not only tDCS but also a ""sham"" placebo, which is often neglected in tDCS stimulation studies. Further, tDCS needs to be applied in a large (n > 20) sample of well-defined migraine patients, which would be advantageous, compared to previously published work. Monitoring sources of regional neuronal alterations in migraineurs prior and after tDCS is essential to investigate physiological mechanisms of tDCS.

This trial will provide important information for determining the efficacy of a novel and promising intervention for women with PVD.",,,Vulvodynia|Vulvar Vestibulitis,"Pain during intercourse will be assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain at all, and 10 is the worst pain ever. This method for measuring pain has been shown to detect significant treatment effects in women with PVD and demonstrates a significant positive correlation with other pain intensity measures. Pain during intercourse is the main symptom of PVD and the one that most interferes with quality of life, hence the most relevant measure of functional outcome (Bergeron et al., 2008; Bergeron et al., 2001; Morin et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2011).","The McGill-Melzack questionnaire allows the assessment of sensory, affective and evaluative components of pain. This world-renowned questionnaire, studied for its validity, reliability and responsiveness to change, is commonly used in RCTs (Bergeron et al., 2001; Melzack, 1975; Davidoff et al., 1987; Hays et al., 1994; Bansal et al., 2009; Moy et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2010).|A gradual pressure (1 to 1000 g) will be applied to three distinct points of the vestibule at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions (Cyr et al., 2014). Each of these pressure points will be applied randomly (e.g. 3,6,9 or 3,9,6 or 6,9,3.). During this procedure, each participant will be asked to indicate when they start to feel pain (pain threshold) and subsequently the maximal pressure that can be tolerated (pain tolerance). Pain intensity is assessed throughout the test using a Computerized Visual analog scale (CoVas). This assessment has shown good reliability and validity (Cyr et al., 2014).|The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a multidimensional measure of sexual function evaluating desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. In addition to good psychometric properties (reliability, internal consistency and responsiveness to change (Rosen et al., 2000; Goldfinger et al, 2009), normative data are available for this questionnaire suggesting clinical level of dysfunctions (Wiegel et al., 2005).|Pain catastrophizing will be assessed using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan, Bishop, & Pivik, 1995), which consists of 13 items measuring exaggerated negative thoughts and feelings about the meaning of pain. Items are scored on a 5-point scale with the end points (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS is a reliable and valid measure that has demonstrated a stable factorial structure across clinical and general populations, including a French population (French et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2000; Sullivan, et al., 1995).|Anxiety will be assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI - (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970); ASTA - (Gauthier & Bouchard, 1993)). The STAI is a 40-item, well-known and widely used measure of state and trait anxiety that has demonstrated very good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha State = .93, Trait = .97) in various clinical and non-clinical samples including pain populations (Gauthier & Bouchard, 1993; Greenberg & Burns, 2003; Rule & Traver, 1983; Tanaka-Masumi & Kameoka, 1986).|Depression or depression symptoms will be measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI-II is comprised of 21 items, with scores for most items ranging from 0 (low intensity) to 3 (high intensity) (Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996; Beck, Steer & Garvin, 1988). This measure of depression has been validated for use in chronic pain populations (Turner & Romano, 1984).|The Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-20), evaluating fear of pain, also shows good psychometric properties (Coons, Hadjistavropoulos & Asmundson, 2004; McCracken & Dhingra, 2002).|Patient self-reported improvement [scale of 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)] and treatment satisfaction [scale of 0 (worse) to 10 (complete cure)] will be measured at the 2-week post-treatment and 3-month post-treatment structured interview in order to assess the clinical significance of results.|Sexual satisfaction will be assessed using the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction scale, which consists of 5 items assessing global sexual satisfaction.

TSPS will be calculated as the difference between heat pain rating after the 15th stimulus minus the 1st stimulus.","Single and Paired Pulse TMS will be used to measure cortical mapping and cortical excitability. We will investigate changes in cortical excitability evaluating the motor evoked potential (MEP) and the resting motor threshold (MT) as well as short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) using the paired-pulse technique.|EEG is a reliable tool to measure electrical activity in the brain. The use of EEG can identify features of cortical excitability and inhibitory activities, as well as thalamocortical rhythm's abnormalities. This is particularly important for understanding the processing of nociception, given that the power of different EEG bandwidths have been shown to be associated with the intensity of pain experience. EEG activity will be assessed in all participants using standardized procedures. The use of EEG in this protocol is exploratory and will be sampled using a 64 channel EGI system (EGI, Eugene, United States of America,). This is a portable, comfortable system that requires the placement of a cap with active electrodes. In total, this component of the visit is expected to take about 30 min typically. EEG will be collected with eyes open, eyes closed during rest and also with motor tasks (mental imagery, movement observation and actual movement).|The BPI is a short self-assessment questionnaire that provides information on various dimensions of pain including how pain developed, the types of pain a patient experiences, time of day pain is experienced, as well as current ways of alleviating pain. The BPI also includes the VAS Pain scale, a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine'') measuring patients' worst pain and least pain, on average and at present time. The BPI provides information on the intensity of pain (the sensory dimension) as well as the degree to which pain interferes with function (the reactive dimension).|A 21-item, multiple-choice questionnaire will be administered at the beginning of the study and at follow-up, in order to assess function, overall impact and symptoms.|A 21-item, multiple-choice questionnaire will be administered at the beginning of the study and at follow-up to assess the presence and degree of depression in adults, as studies in chronic pain have found that depression can modulate pain perception.|We will obtain a medication use history at study entry using a standardized questionnaire similar to that used in our prior studies, and update this information at each subsequent visit. We will also monitor patient medication throughout the course of the study using a subject Medication Diary. Participants will be required to record medications daily in a pain medication diary. Participants will be instructed to keep the pain medication diary throughout the baseline, treatment, and follow-up period.

It assesses 7 components of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Scoring of the answers is based on a Likert scale from ""0"" (not during the past month) to ""3"" (3 or more times week). A total sum of ""5"" or greater indicates a ""poor"" sleeper. This instrument can be used to assess quality of sleep (i.e., poor or good sleep quality) in several time points of a given intervention (from baseline assessment to follow ups).|running speed, HR range and distance that have been ran for the 30 minutes of exercise will be collected during exercise.|At the end of each stimulation session, subjects will complete a 5-point scale questionnaire that evaluates potential common adverse effects of tDCS (headache, neck pain, scalp pain, scalp burning sensation, tingling, skin redness, sleepiness, concentration, and acute mood change).|During each AE session, subjects will be monitored (HR variability). The session will be stopped if the HR is superior to 80% of HRmax, or if the patient presents any signs of discomfort.

The 2010 INCA report showed that France is not an exception to this worldwide observation (synopsis of the 2010 national survey). This report shows that pain is the symptom that these patients fear the most and that it dramatically impacts their quality of life. These patients may experience nociceptive pain related to stimulation of sensory nerve endings by the tumour. When tumour resection is impossible, a symptomatic analgesic treatment is generally proposed, mainly consisting of administration of opioid analgesics. At high doses, this treatment induces adverse effects, especially drowsiness and psychomotor retardation that impair the patient's quality of life.||They may also experience neuropathic pain, secondary to anatomical lesions or functional impairment of nerve structures (peripheral nerves or cerebral or spinal tracts) related to repeated surgical procedures and/or radiotherapy. This type of pain may respond to antiepileptic or antidepressant drugs. At high doses, these treatments also induce adverse effects fairly similar to those observed during treatment of nociceptive pain. As these two types of treatment often need to be coprescribed, these patients frequently present an almost permanent state of drowsiness at the end of life, preventing all normal activities of daily living.||In recent years, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques (transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS)) have been successfully used to treat chronic pain.

Until now, the only hope for such patients has been the development of new pharmaceutical treatments or epilepsy surgery. In case of inoperability, different types of invasive brain stimulation such as vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation or non-invasive repetitive TMS have been evaluated to determine their anticonvulsive potential. For rTMS, weak and short lasting seizure reduction has been reported in different epilepsy syndromes.||A new, non-invasive stimulation technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), was useful to modulate cortical excitability in many cortical areas (M1, visual cortex, frontal cortex). Cathodal tDCS, with a current of 1 mA, induced long-term depression in animal models and reportedly decreased the excitability of both human and animal cerebral cortex. In epilepsy patients suffering from a malformation of cortical development, a single session of cathodal tDCS helped reduce seizures briefly. The purpose of this protocol is to study the effects of repeated applications of tDCS on the excitability of the seizure focus in patients with poorly controlled pharmacologically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.||STUDY POPULATION:||We plan to study 56 patients between the ages of 18 and 80 suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy.||DESIGN:||Subjects will be allocated by blocked randomization to one of two groups (parallel design). Group A will receive cathodal tDCS and group B will receive Sham-tDCS on five consecutive days. Each subject will participate in 9 sessions (1 baseline visit, 5 intervention visits, 3 follow-up visits). The effect of the intervention relative to the sham stimulation will be evaluated by comparing seizure frequency and neuropsychological tests during the 8 weeks before and after the intervention.||OUTCOME MEASURES:||Primary outcome measure will be the mean seizure frequency per 4 weeks in the tDCS group as compared to the Sham-tDCS group. To analyze the effect of the intervention (tDCS), seizures will be evaluated during a 2x4 week baseline period before tDCS and 2x4 weeks after the intervention. Using these data we will calculate the percentage change of seizures per 4 weeks.||Secondary outcome measures will be the scores of the neuropsychological testing (HVLT-R, BVMT-R, CTMT, COWAT) and number of epileptiform discharges in the EEG.

The border profile of a physiotherapy researcher is to be in front of applied research amplification in experimental integrative approaches, involving the study of behavioral and physiological variables.||The rehabilitation process transcends the systems physiology and encompasses the cognitive behavioral feature of being adapted to the environment that surround us. It is now known by the scientific rehabilitation community the necessity for evidence based therapies and even more, therapeutic innovation. In both conditions, of health and illness, various options to use integrative approaches are today available in physiotherapy, including behavioral and physiological profiles of the individuals during physical activities, response to stress and in the field of chronic pain.||It is in the clinical routine of numerous rehabilitation centers the treatment of diseases that causes pain, being the leading figure in a physiotherapist work process. The innovative study of resources that can alter the pain state of this patients becomes primordial for routine clinical use, low cost and easy to apply. The therapeutic treatment for pain offered by a physiotherapist need new investigative options based in evidences from the association between the neuronal, behavioral and physiological responses where the brain is the central organ of this regulation. In this context, become increasingly more necessary the construction of investigative approaches in the purpose of reaching the clinical practice, in a reduced time lapse, once the great volume of information produced globally does not impact in short or medium term in new therapeutic recommendations.||Among the various chronic painful entities, it is presented the fibromyalgia (FM), painful diabetic polyneuropathy and primary dysmenorrhea because of its painful pathogenic complexity and its limited therapeutic against pain in rehabilitation process. The 3 painful entities presents the central nervous system as main participant of neurogenesis and maintenance of the painful state.||It is primordial importance that rehabilitation science improve methods of non invasive brain neuromodulation that allows, through excitation or inhibition of specific cortical areas in order to produce pain inhibition, providing a simple and low cost treatment to clinical routine. Technological advances and non invasive techniques to modulate brain function has been developed, among which transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stands out. Basically, electrodes are placed in targeted brain regions that you want to stimulate or inhibit. Posteriorly, is applied a continuous electric current (0,4 - 2 mA) for a 3-20 minutes period, in order to modify cortical excitability. The stimulus of the anodic current increases cortical excitability whereas the stimulus of the cathodic current has an inhibitory effect.||Few are the research groups that address the issue of fibromyalgia, painful diabetic polyneuropathy and primary dysmenorrhea and the application of tDCS as research focus, being a border area for rehabilitation science and great potential in clinical use. Preliminary studies associates the use of tDCS with the decrease of painful state, however an approach of physical function and behavioral results needs greater investigation.||The purpose of the presented project is to present the tDCS as a new modality in physical rehabilitation for the patient with chronic pain of the 3 entities mentioned above.
