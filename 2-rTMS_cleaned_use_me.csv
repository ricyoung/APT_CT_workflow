Recent developments in neuroimaging have focus on the reasons why some patients recover well while some do poorly. However, there is still no consensus on the exact mechanisms involved in regaining the functions after rehabilitation. Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to facilitate neural plasticity during stroke treatment has recently gained considerable attention. The possible mechanism through which rTMS acts is based on the interhemispheric competition (IHC) model, which explains that patients with stroke experience alterations in cortical excitability and exhibit abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemisphere. The visual feedback training can improve postural control and enhance motor performance. Several rTMS studies have evaluated the lower extremity dysfunction following stroke, but few studies have explored the efficacy of applying rTMS on the lower extremities.

It is still singularly difficult to predict who is going to commit suicide and how to establish adequate interventions. Growing evidence supports the view that suicide is associated with poor decision making. Suicide is hypothesized to be triggered by stressful situations that create overwhelming psychological pain in an individual who chooses to terminate his/her own life, disregarding all future consequences. We have previously demonstrated rewarding impulsive choice common to both recent suicide attempters and suicidal depressed patients (1). Consistent with these findings, we hypothesize that high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left prefrontal cortex will improve impulsive response tendencies as measured by the delay discounting procedure, and this in turn will be associated with a faster resolution of suicidal ideation. To these effects we will be using a randomized control trial of rTMS in adult inpatients at the Psychiatric Research Institute (PRI) hospitalized for acute suicidality.

It includes a recognition that other individuals experience thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires that may be different to our own. ToM is often impaired among individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (such as autism and Asperger's disorder), and may underlie aspects of social dysfunction in this population. Indeed, it has been suggested that impaired ToM is the core deficit of autism and Asperger's disorder.||Imaging studies suggest that the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, the most important brain region in ToM processing, is underactive in autism. The current study examines whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex can modulate ToM ability among healthy adults, and improve ToM ability among adults with autism or Asperger's disorder. With the prevalence of autism increasing, there is a clear need to develop appropriate therapeutic interventions to improve social functioning.||This study involves a double-blind study using high-frequency rTMS in an attempt to improve ToM among adults with either autism or Asperger's disorder. Theory of mind will be measured using behavioural tasks that require the participant to infer what someone is thinking or feeling by observing their behaviour. These tasks will administered both before and after rTMS to determine whether any change in theory of mind has occurred.||Thirty adults with either autism (n = 15) or Asperger's disorder (n = 15) will initially undergo functional and structural MRI to determine the site on the scalp that lies over the medial prefrontal cortex (to which rTMS will be administered).

Preliminary attempts have been made to use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a non-pharmacological treatment alternative, but thus far rTMS approaches have demonstrated only modest efficacy. A major factor contributing to these limited effects stems from the depth penetration of TMS, which is not sufficient to directly modulate deep subcortical structures, such as the amygdala, that are affected in PTSD. Moreover, while rTMS effects have been shown to be state-dependent, (i.e. vary substantially according to the neural state during stimulation), this important factor is rarely considered during the clinical application of rTMS. The current study addresses both of these limitations to improve the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS for PTSD. Here we will develop a protocol to test if connectivity-based rTMS is able to modulate amygdala activity through the functional connections with medial prefrontal cortex, taking advantage of state-dependency to enhance rTMS effects by actively engaging the amygdala through a fear perception task. BOLD activation in the amygdala and its connectivity with the frontal cortex will constitute the primary outcomes to test rTMS efficacy.

Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is a type of focal dystonia characterized by excessive contraction of intrinsic muscles in the larynx, leading to difficulty in speaking and affecting effective communication. The cause of SD is unknown and there are no treatments that produce long-term benefits. Previous studies have suggested that SD and other focal dystonias are associated with decreased inhibition in sensorimotor areas in the brain. However, no studies have investigated the effects of modulating excitability of the laryngeal motor cortex in healthy individuals or SD. The goal of this pilot project is to determine if brain excitability of the laryngeal motor cortex can be changed with low-frequency inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in individuals with SD and healthy controls. Considering that rTMS at low frequencies (≤1 Hz) produces lasting inhibition in the brain, and that SD is associated with decreased cortical inhibition, the purpose of this pilot study is to determine safety, feasibility and response to 1Hz rTMS to the laryngeal motor cortex in individuals with SD and healthy people. The results will help understand changes associated with the disorder, as well as contribute to the development of future clinical interventions for SD.",,,Dysphonia|Hoarseness|Dystonia|Dystonic Disorders,Count of participants who experience and adverse response to rTMS treatment.|The change from baseline in CSP duration will be reported.

Voice breaks will be measured by asking subjects to repeat 10 sentences. The frequency of voice breaks in the recorded 10 sentences will be counted.|CAPE-V (overall severity) testing before and after rTMS consisted of the repetition of six sentences and two sustained vowels (/a/;/i/). A short sample of spontaneous speech (approximately 60s) was also collected for qualitative analysis of voice. The CAPE-V ratings were completed by three assessors who were blinded to group and pre/post-test. The assessors listened to the voice recordings for each participant and rated them for all six parameters listed above from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating worse severity. Ratings for each voice parameter were then averaged across the three assessors. We chose to analyze the change in the CAPE-V parameter for ""Overall Severity"" to represent an overall assessment of voice quality from pre- to post-rTMS (Post Score - Pre Score) as it had the greatest likelihood of detecting any small changes that may be perceived.|Quantitative assessment of voice quality was completed with acoustic analysis of each participant's production of the ten sentences from the Spasmodic Dysphonia Attribute Inventory (SDAI). A custom script in Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2018) was used to calculate cepstral peak prominence smoothed (CPPS) for each sentence production. CPPS is a relatively new measure that reflects vocal fold periodicity and noise components in the vocal spectrum. CPPS has been found to be correlated with perceived severity of voice symptoms and higher CPPS values represent a more normal vocal quality. CPPS values (in dB) were averaged across the ten sentences of the SDAI to derive an average CPPS for each participant before and after rTMS. Change for each participant was calculated as the average CPPS at post-rTMS minus average CPPS at pre-rTMS. The values for each group were then averaged to report the average change in CPPS for Controls and Spasmodic Dysphonia.",20,Actual,<=18 years|Between 18 and 65 years|>=65 years|Female|Male|American Indian or Alaska Native|Asian|Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander|Black or African American|White|More than one race|Unknown or Not Reported,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Primary inclusion for spasmodic dysphonia:||Diagnosis of adductor spasmodic dysphonia|Symptoms at worst severity if receiving regular botulinum injections||Primary inclusion for healthy participants (controls):||Absence of vocal fold pathology||Exclusion Criteria:||Primary exclusion for participants with spasmodic dysphonia:||Other forms of dystonia|Vocal fold pathology or paralysis|Diagnosis of voice tremor|Laryngeal surgery|Laryngeal cancer or neurological condition other than dystonia|Contraindication to TMS|Medications with effect on central nervous system|Inability to complete tasks associated with study|Adult lacking ability to consent||Primary exclusion for healthy participants (controls):||Any health condition or disability that would interfere with participation|Contraindications to TMS|Medications with effect on central nervous system|Adult lacking ability to consent||TMS contraindications:||The only absolute contraindication to TMS/rTMS is the presence of metallic hardware in close contact to the discharging coil (such as cochlear implants, deep brain stimulator, or medication pumps).

However if its efficiency has been recognized by the scientific community and the clinicians, its action on neurons and cerebral networks remains debated.||In the motor regions, the different rTMS studies generally use frequencies of stimulation of 1 to 40 Hz with differential effects; the low frequencies being associated with an inhibitory effect whereas highest frequencies have rather some facilitator effects as attested by the motor responses. What is valid for the motor system is not however necessarily applicable to other cerebral regions that have different neuronal organizations. If it is easy to observe these opposite effects of rTMS on the motor system (presence or absence of movements), these potential effects on more integrated cortex involved in high level functions have not been proved.||One of the possibilities to interpret the effects of the rTMS in no-motor cerebral regions would be to study the modifications of the EEG before and after rTMS and to see if a differential effect of the high and low frequencies of stimulation exists. Up to now, the studies having coupled these two techniques have observed modifications of the brain electric activity only during some seconds to minutes after rTMS, what appears in contrast with the clinical effects observed after a long delay (several days).||The contribution of our research resides in the use of the paradigm of suppression of P50 evoked potential component before and after rTMS tested with low and high frequencies of stimulation. This paradigm consists in two identical auditory stimuli presented at a very short interval (generally 500 milliseconds), the second sound generating a P50 wave of weaker amplitude than the first or being completely abolished in healthy subjects. However, this effect that has been well studied could result from an inhibitory action due to the gabaergic interneurons on the pyramidal neurons of the cortex. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that high frequency rTMS would have a facilitator effect on temporal lobe and so would induce no suppression of the P50 after-rTMS whereas low frequency rTMS would induce an inhibitory effect marked by a greater suppression of the P50.||Methods: 30 healthy subjects (of which 16 women) will be included after written consent. They will receive after randomization 2 sessions of rTMS in cross over at 1Hz and 20Hz at 30 days interval. An EEG and a P50 evoked potential will be done before and after rTMS. The site of stimulation will be determined by neuronavigation and will correspond to the maximal activation cluster generated by a language task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The main judgment criterion is the S2/S1 ratio of the P50. The potential secondary effects will be evaluated (UKU adapted).

The aim is to determine how existing non-invasive neuromodulation devices affect brain circuitry as measured by EEG recording. Currently, the application of non-invasive neuromodulation is rarely guided by detailed knowledge of how neural activity is altered in the brain circuits that are targeted for intervention. This gap in knowledge is problematic for interpreting response variability, which is common. To address this gap, the current proposal aims to combine two forms of neuromodulation sequentially, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at different frequencies of rTMS. Homeostatic plasticity, the initial activation state of a targeted circuit, is a key determinant of whether rTMS induces long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) Yet, homeostatic plasticity is rarely measured or controlled in rTMS studies. We aim to control homeostatic plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS prior to rTMS delivery.

Moreover, cannabis is the most commonly used drug among patients with an existing psychotic disorder. An estimated 25% of patients with psychosis reportedly meet the criteria of a cannabis use disorder particularly among younger patients experiencing their first episode. Cannabis use significantly exacerbates symptomatology resulting in an increased duration of the first hospitalization visit, number of hospital readmissions, and overall reduced functional outcome. Discovering novel strategies to treat the underlying pathophysiology of cannabis dependence early in the disorder may translate into improved functional outcome. Working memory deficits have been shown to predict relapse in the first-year of psychosis and is modulated with cannabis use. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has shown tremendous promise for the treatment of both tobacco dependence and working memory impairment in patients with psychosis possibly through the modulation of gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations. The proposed study will therefore evaluate the effect of rTMS on abstinence, working memory performance, and gamma oscillations through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 28-day longitudinal abstinence study design in patients with early psychosis.

Unfortunately, treatments which are conventionally used to treat adult depression have often modest to no efficacy in youth and have side effects. Thus, there is a tremendous imperative to develop new treatments for youth depression. Investigators propose to examine the efficacy of a short form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for youth depression and examine its biological targets. This will be the first study examining the efficacy of a short rTMS protocol in youth diagnosed with depression who fail responding to or are intolerable to antidepressants. If the results are positive, investigators will have identified a novel treatment that may be both more efficacious, better tolerated and more acceptable treatment for youth depression.

However, neuroimaging studies of tinnitus patients show hyperactivity in several cortical regions, especially the auditory cortices and middle temporal regions. A potentially promising treatment modality for tinnitus is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS involves the application of frequent, repeated magnetic stimuli to the skull to induce electrical activity in the underlying cortical areas of the brain. When the magnetic device is placed on the skull, the resultant magnetic field passes through the skull and induces a small secondary current in the cortex. It has been hypothesized that the effect of the frequency used in rTMS differentially influences cortical activity with low-frequency (1Hz) stimulation decreasing and high-frequency stimulation (10-20 Hz) increasing cortical activity.||Currently, reports on treating tinnitus with rTMS have focused on low-frequency stimulation of the left auditory cortex, an area that has been demonstrated to be hyperactive in tinnitus. The benefits of low-frequency auditory cortex stimulation are time limited however. Converging data implicate structures of the brain that are important for mood and attention as playing a role in the maintenance of tinnitus; suggesting an alternative rTMS treatment approach that targets these structures. A growing number of studies demonstrate involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. rTMS stimulation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in association with stimulation in the temporoparietal cortex has been shown to increase the durability of the TPC stimulation. The independent effect of rTMS stimulation to the DLPFC is not known. Studies in depression suggest that increasing the intensity and duration of stimulation has beneficial treatment effects. However, the field is new and more work is needed to assess the effectiveness of this treatment, predictors and correlates of response, and safety.||Herein, we propose an open-label pilot study investigating the effectiveness of rTMS stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area known to be important for mood and attention, in the treatment of tinnitus",,,Tinnitus,"Patient self-reported Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) The mean change (95% CI) in THI scores (Baseline - End of Treatment).

Stimulation is typically applied at sufficient intensity to trigger action potentials in nearby neurons.The motor threshold is defined as the minimum percentage of the stimulator output to elicit a motor evoked potential. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) was delivered at 100% of the motor evoked potential threshold with repeated magnetic pulses at a frequency of 20 Hz. Functional MRI (fMRI) measures the change in oxygenated blood in the brain; at rest these levels fluctuate over time. These fluctuations can be similar between different parts of the brain. FC is the similarity in fluctuations of these fMRI signals and suggest how strongly two regions communicate with each other. We measured how TMS can change FC between specific areas of the brain. A positive score suggests a stronger communication between regions of the brain.|Participants studied 20 face-word pairs, and after a short delay, were required to recall the word associated with each pair. The number of correctly remembered pairs was recorded. rTMS was administered over different regions of the brain over 3 days. The Associative Memory test was administered at baseline (within a week before the first rTMS session), 1 day after the last rTMS session, and again 7-14 days after the last rTMS session. We calculated improvements on this task by subtracting the number of successfully remembered pairs 1 day after stimulation from the number remembered at baseline (""Changes one day after rTMS""). We also calculated whether these improvements lasted longer by subtracting the number of successfully remembered pairs 7-14 days after stimulation from the number remembered at baseline (""Changes 7-14 days after rTMS"").

However, this is often a difficult task to accomplish due to not only to damage from the stroke, but from increased excitability in the non-stroke side of the brain that inhibits the stroke side from functioning optimally. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that can enhance excitability in the stroke side when applied at a low-frequency on the non-stroke side. By ""inhibiting the inhibition"" (i.e. disinhibition), rTMS promotes adaptive brain reorganization following stroke. Previous research in healthy individuals demonstrates enhanced effects of low-frequency rTMS when it is preceded by high-frequency (excitatory) rTMS stimulation known as priming. Our lab previously demonstrated the safety of 6-Hz priming with low-frequency rTMS in both adults and children with chronic stroke. However, it is currently unknown whether or not the addition of priming stimulation to low-frequency rTMS enhances excitability in the stroke hemisphere. Our study will examine three rTMS interventions in twelve adults (at least 18 years): 1.) 10 minutes of real priming followed by 10 minutes of low-frequency rTMS, 2.) 10 minutes of fake priming followed by 10 minutes of low-frequency rTMS, 3.) 20 minutes of low-frequency rTMS only. Participants will receive all three interventions in randomized order. Each week, participants will complete two pretest and 3 posttest sessions consisting of behavioral measures of weak upper extremity function and cortical excitability in addition to receiving one rTMS intervention. Following each week of testing and treatment, subjects will take a one week rest break before crossing-over to receive another intervention. We hypothesize the following: 1.) Primed rTMS will result in significantly reduced inhibition and significantly increased excitation on the stroke side vs. fake primed rTMS or low-frequency rTMS given alone and 2.) Primed rTMS will result in greater improvements of paretic hand function.

Many of these stroke survivors are living with disabilities that limit their everyday function. One of the major consequences of stroke is loss of sensation which manifests as inability to perceive touch, temperature, pain or limb movement. Lack of sensation hinders full functional recovery. Current treatments for sensory loss produce only limited improvements and do not achieve full recovery. Therefore, it is critical to develop new therapies to re-train sensory function. The investigators propose to evaluate a novel non-invasive brain stimulation treatment called repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS).

Disruption of the excitability in the non-stroke hemisphere, with resultant increased excitability (disinhibition) in the stroke hemisphere, can be achieved with low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive method of stimulating targeted areas of the brain. Furthermore, the disruptive effects of low-frequency rTMS can be increased and prolonged by preceding it with 6-Hz priming stimulation. We have recently demonstrated the safety of this priming/low-frequency rTMS in adults with stroke and we are currently engaged in an NIH-funded study exploring the effectiveness, mechanism and safety of serial treatments of rTMS combined with motor learning training. Very little research, however, has been attempted on interventions to promote brain reorganization and recovery in hemiplegia in children. Thus, this study will determine the effectiveness, mechanism, and safety of 5 treatments of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS applied to the non-stroke hemisphere and combined with constraint induced therapy (CIT) to promote recovery of the paretic hand. Fifteen children with pediatric hemiplegia, age 8 -16 years, at each of two pediatric medical facilities (total N = 30), will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups that will receive treatment for 2 weeks. The rTMSreal/CIT group will receive alternating days of the real rTMS and CIT for 5 treatments of each. The rTMSsham/CIT group will receive alternating days of sham rTMS with real CIT for 5 treatments of each. Subjects will be tested at pretest and posttest. The hypotheses are: 1) the rTMS treatment will show no serious side effects, 2) both groups will show improvement in hand function but the rTMSsham/CIT group will show significantly greater improvement, 3) the rTMSreal/CIT group will also show significantly greater improvements in brain reorganization measured by paired-pulse TMS testing, cortical silent period testing, and fMRI. The proposed research is important because very little research on rehabilitation-induced brain reorganization has been done in pediatric hemiplegia. It is innovative because it applies a technique never used before, i.e. 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS combined with CIT. The potential impact of this research is a radical change to pediatric rehabilitation that accomplishes a higher functional recovery.",,,Hemiplegia,Hand function will be assessed at pretest and posttest by a tester rating the child's performance on designated motor tasks,Cortical excitability of the primary motor cortex of the stroke hemisphere will be assessed using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation.,19,Actual,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||at least 10 degrees of active finger (metacarpophalangeal joint) and wrist flexion/extension motion,|ability to see whether a computer screen cursor is slightly above/below a target line,|ability to understand finger tracking test evidenced by a score above 0,|evidence of an MEP in paretic hand muscle with TMS testing of ipsilesional M1, age-equivalent receptive language function.||Exclusion Criteria:||metabolic disorders,|neoplasm,|seizures,|disorders of cellular migration and proliferation,|lack of age appropriate receptive language function,|expressive aphasia,|pregnancy,|claustrophobia,|indwelling metal or MRI incompatible medical devices,|gross visual field cuts.",,No,25283350|23962321,Minneapolis,United States,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01104064"", ""NCT01104064"")"

One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences, often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.||In most people, Broca's area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca's area (the pars triangularis), may adopt language function.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote recovery of function in the perilesional area.

As such, there is a desperate need for novel treatment strategies in PPA.||Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, non-invasive way of stimulating cortical targets in a focal and reproducible manner. Therapeutic benefits from rTMS have been demonstrated when it is applied in many sequential sessions. For example, repeated sessions of rTMS to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is approved by the US Food and Drug administration as a treatment for major depressive disorder. With respect to language, high frequency rTMS increases the response rate for picture naming in healthy individuals. rTMS has also been shown to improve the number of correct naming responses in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Further, in a sham controlled study, Cotelli and colleagues demonstrated that in a group of 10 nfvPPA patients high frequency rTMS over the left and right dlPFC during object and action naming tasks improved the percent of correct responses for action, but not object naming.

Up to now, the target of stimulation has been over the left temporoparietal region (based on the international 10-20 EEG system) and rTMS has been delivered at low frequency (1 Hz).||High frequency (20 Hz) might allow shortening the duration of treatment and so could be more convenient for the patient (2 days at high frequency instead of 15 days at low frequency).||Besides high frequency, an accurate target taking into account the inter-subjects anatomical variability might increase the efficacy. Based on a great overlap of language and auditory hallucinations networks, the investigators hypothesized that targeting the stimulation on the highest cluster of activation induced by a language task could be an easier and relevant method to determine the target. The investigators suggest that the best area is located at the posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus (STS). Indeed, this area is considered as an "" epicenter "" of language, i.e., involved both in understanding and production of language and in the auditory hallucination network. Therefore, the investigators conducted an open pilot study in order to test the interest of rTMS at high frequency (20 Hz) associated with anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuronavigation in 11 schizophrenic patients with hallucinations. The investigators showed a significant reduction of auditory hallucinations; Seven out of 11 patients (63.8%) were considered as responders at day 12 with a decrease of more than 30% of the score of Hoffman's scale (Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale) ; 2 patients presented a drastic improvement with no hallucinations after 12 days of rTMS. The investigators also showed the target based on anatomical and functional MRI was located at the intersection of the left STS and the coronal slice across the vertical line of sylvius sulcus.||The aim of this multicentric double-blind study (randomized and placebo sham) is to demonstrate the efficacy of rTMS at high frequency with neuronavigation in the treatment of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorders (DSMIV-R).||Methods:||72 subjects will be included after written consent. After randomization, the subject will receive in a double blind either active treatment or placebo (sham coil) treatment.||rTMS : 4 sessions of 13 minutes, with 2 sessions a day, at 20Hz frequency and at an intensity of 80% of rest motor threshold will be delivered. These parameters allow the investigators to be under the risk of epilepsia, the only one severe side effect. Another mild side effect is headache easily treated by antalgic drugs. The target will be established with anatomical MRI eventually associated with functional MRI before treatment.||The efficacy of treatment will be evaluated over 4 weeks (D0, D1, D2, D7, D14, D21 and D30). The primary assessment is the percentage of patients who present a decrease of more than 30% of the frequency item of Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) between D1 and D30 at 2 evaluations spaced of 1 week (Responder patients). The secondary assessments are : 1- Relative decrease of frequency item of AHRS between D1 and D14 ; 2- Evolution of total score of AHRS at D1, D2, D7, D14, D21 and D30 ; 3- Variation of scores of CGI, SUMD, IS, positive, negative, general and total PANSS scores between D0 and D14 and D30 ; 4- Scores at secondary side effects (adapted UKU) at D2 and D7; 5- Distances between the present target and the classical target based on 10-20 EEG system (T3P3) and/or the target established with functional MRI (cluster of activations induced by a listening comprehension task).",,,Hallucinations|Schizophrenia,,,72,Actual,,,,,Inclusion Criteria:||Patients with schizophrenic disorders aged from 16 to 65 years old|Patients suffering from auditory hallucinations (score AHRS > 10) undergoing antipsychotic treatments|patients clinically stabilised (no antipsychotic treatments modifications for the last 2 months|Written signed consent||Exclusion Criteria:||Pregnancy or breastfeeding|patients with a brain tumor|Patients with previous history of epilepsy|Patients already treated once by rTMS|Counter-indication to MRI or to rTMS,,No,,Caen,France,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01022489"", ""NCT01022489"")"

A great deal of the cognitive decline due to aging can be explained by decline in working memory (WM), a mental function central to cognition in which aging deficits appear almost universally. Attempts to use WM training to increase WM ability in older adults has had some success, but the transfer of performance enhancements caused by this training to other cognitive skills is controversial. Another intervention that shows much promise is noninvasive stimulation of cerebral cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which has been shown to increase performance in many cognitive tasks.||Here, the investigator proposes to use fMRI-guided rTMS to enhance working memory performance. This will be achieved through three Aims. In the first, registered on this record, the investigator will stimulate both old and young healthy adults while they perform the WM task that will engage the frontoparietal network. To define the optimal rTMS target, rTMS will be applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC: Aim 1a); or over the parietal cortex (PC: Aim 1b). These regions are involved not only in the maintenance of items in WM, but also in their manipulation, therefore applying rTMS over these areas should create WM performance enhancements that will be long-lasting. In Aim 1c, a direct within-subject comparison of these 2 targeted sites is performed.||In the second and third Aims, older adults will receive active or sham rTMS over the optimal target (defined in Arm 1) during two weeks of daily sessions while they perform the WM tasks. In the second Aim, the investigator hopes to demonstrate that the cumulative effect of multiple TMS sessions, in tandem with the synergistic effects of simultaneous TMS + WM training, create WM performance enhancements greater than those found with WM training alone, whose effects are long-lasting, continuing a month following the course of TMS sessions. In the third, the investigator will investigate whether the WM enhancements generated by the two weeks of TMS sessions will generalize to other cognitive tasks. The success of these 3 Aims will provide proof in principle for long-lasting, transferable effects of TMS in remediating WM and more general cognitive deficits due to aging, and point to a possible non-invasive brain stimulation therapy for cognitive decline in healthy aging and in dementia.

One of the features of schizophrenia is reduced cognitive abilities, such as poor attention and memory. It is thought that people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes to reduce these cognitive problems, as nicotine can improve cognitive function in these people. When people with schizophrenia stop smoking it causes further cognitive difficulties, which makes quitting harder for them compared to people without schizophrenia. A method called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) allows clinicians to give repeated magnetic pulses through the scalp to cause changes in brain activity and behaviour. rTMS can improve cognitive function in people with schizophrenia. Studies have also shown that rTMS can reduce tobacco craving and consumption of cigarettes. Therefore, we believe that rTMS will improve the cognitive deficits observed during cigarette smoking abstinence and help reduce cravings for cigarettes. Ultimately, rTMS may help smokers with schizophrenia who can't quit smoking with available treatments. This study will examine the effect of rTMS on tobacco cravings and cognitive problems produced by overnight abstinence from cigarette smoking in persons with schizophrenia in comparison to people without mental illness who smoke. Important information about the potential of rTMS for the treatment of cognitive deficits and tobacco addiction in schizophrenia will be obtained.

Satisfactory management is often difficult to achieve and different clinical trials with medical and surgical measures have yielded unsatisfactory results.

After the initial recovery phase, only limited gains are achieved by retraining the weak limb to perform daily tasks. However, new treatment strategies such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show promise for enhancing motor recovery after stroke. rTMS is a noninvasive technique for modifying brain activity that aims to improve motor function by correcting abnormal patterns that occur after stroke. We believe that giving rTMS right before a therapy session will prepare the brain so that the patient is better able to participate in and benefit from training of the hand and arm. The goal of this study is to test how well this new strategy works to improve recovery in people who have mild to moderate weakness of the arm and hand after stroke.||Participants will receive magnetic stimulation of the movement area of the brain just prior to arm and hand training for a series of eight sessions. We will evaluate changes in hand and arm function after the intervention and one month later to see if the changes are maintained.

The DMFPC is a novel target for rTMS, is heavily implicated in the regulation of mood and affect, and has been suggested to be involved in AN, BN, major depression, OCD, and PTSD. Improved function in this area might lead to reduced AN and BN symptoms, such as bingeing, purging, and over-activity, perhaps by improved regulation of mood and affect. Improvements in important areas of comorbidity might allow for better response to intensive treatment for AN and BN, and reduce relapse rates after such treatment. The DMPFC may be a more appropriate target for compared to the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), which has typically been the focus of stimulation in the past. Our initial preliminary pilot work has noted unexpected and significant improvements in some core ED symptoms (bingeing and purging) and in important areas of comorbidity (OCD and PTSD), along with expected improvements in mood. These changes have allowed some treatment resistant patients to either complete intensive treatment or be successful in maintaining their progress post intensive treatment.

Neurostimulation affects multiple sites within a cortical network, but these global effects have not been used as targets for stimulation because of limited knowledge about what influence these localized sites have on global changes in brain state. To address this problem, multimodal neuroimaging tools and network modeling approaches developed though the parent U01 project will be used, to demonstrate how focal neurostimulation improves the efficacy of TMS for enhancing memory function. These goals will be addressed in the Administrative Supplement under our two specific aims. First, network-guided TMS will be applied to optimize memory success based in the frontoparietal network (FPN) in a new group of MCI patients. A new form of TMS targeting that involves modeling of the global network to understand how the controllability of a stimulation site evokes changes in widespread brain networks will be tested. Second, structural and functional factors affecting the efficacy of individualized network-guided TMS will be identified to ameliorate deficits in MCI. By creating a multimodal model of neural deficits related to MCI, network-guided TMS will be adjusted to demonstrate how the MCI brain might compensate for these neural deficits. The parent U01 project has made foundational advances towards these goals, as we have demonstrated the ability of to selectively enhance and reduce working memory performance in healthy older adults. In the current Administrative Supplement this paradigm will be extended to a group of MCI participants in order to test the hypothesis that excitatory rTMS to the working memory network can provide positive outcomes for patients with pre-clinical AD. The proposed work will provide an important tool for studying the stability and controllability of network connectivity of memory states in the aging brain, as well as new information on the effectiveness of brain stimulation technologies as a therapeutic approach for cognitive decline.",No,Yes,Cognitive Dysfunction,Accuracy (in percentage) will be assessed to evaluate the acute effect of rTMS.|Reaction times (in ms) will be assessed to evaluate the acute effect of rTMS,,10,Actual,<=18 years|Between 18 and 65 years|>=65 years|Female|Male|American Indian or Alaska Native|Asian|Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander|Black or African American|White|More than one race|Unknown or Not Reported,These participants only performed the behavioral task.

The natural course of MDD tends to worsen without treatment, while people with MDD can lead healthy and productive lives when the illness is effectively treated. Up to 50% of the patients show no response to current available antidepressants.Two major non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) tools have been applied for the treatment of psychiatric diseases so far, transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation (TMS, tDCS). TMS induces a strong magnetic field (magnetic pulses) through the skull into the brain, which generates electrical currents in brain tissue and induces neuronal firing, leading to after-effects, i.e. neuroplasticity, eventually. Neuronal effects of rTMS has been proven to last beyond the actual time of stimulation, enabling altered brain activity for an extended period of time. Adding on rTMS treatment could even give a chance to treat the physical comorbidities and enhance cognitive function in MDD. Nevertheless, underlying neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment remains unclear. Reports showed chronic psychosocial stressors are associated with altered frontal-striatal circuitry activation and connectivity. Indeed, aberrant fronto-striatal connectivity and reduced sustain fronto-striatal activation were noticed in MDD patients. However, the specific correlations between fronto-striatal connectivity changes and rTMS treatment outcomes in MDD remain unclear. In this study fMRI will be used to measure the possible correlations between the fronto-striatal circuit activation / connectivity with (1) mood symptoms presentations, (2) neurocognitive measurements, (3) HPA and ANS activities, and (4) immune and metabolic status (cytokines, adipokines and insulin levels) in patients with MDD. Then the possible changes in fronto-striatal FC over a four-week treatment course with 10 Hz rTMS stimulation to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be measured. The FC changes will be tested to find out whether correlate with treatment outcomes, HPA and ANS activity; and immune/metabolic indices changes.||We hypothesize that rTMS as an add-on therapy would change the fronto-striatal FC that correlated with mood symptom improvement, neurocognitive measurements, HPA and ANS activity, inflammatory and metabolic homeostasis in patients with MDD.",No,No,"Disease|Depressive Disorder|Depression|Depressive Disorder, Major","Evaluation for disease severity by using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) by trained senior psychiatrists.

Mood stabilizers are partially effective in the treatment of depressive phase of the illness, although there are some reports relating to the antidepressant properties of these drugs. Other conventional methods (pharmacological) and non- conventional treatment are not effective or involve risks and side effects. Several studies with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) showed that magnetic stimulation daily over the left prefrontal cortex may improve the mood of patients. TMS is a noninvasive method of stimulating the brain. The instrument used nowadays in local research and application Clinical is a metallic coil formed in figure 8 (coil format 8). This instrument was capable of stimulating only surface areas of the brain, primarily the cerebral cortex, at depths of up to 3 inches below the scalp. From this angle, there is clearly a need for a means of producing magnetic fields which can reach deeper brain areas, such as those involved in mood disorders. TMS has little, if any effect in these brain areas. To this end, new coils, calls ""H"", that promote the stimulation of deep brain areas were developed in collaboration with the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the USA. This new coil - H1 that will be evaluated in this study has been tested for safety in NIH in 2003 by Dr. Abraham Zangen. Yet there are very few prospective clinical, randomized and controlled trials, on the effects of early and late in clinical-cognitive condition and safety of TMS with H1 coils in treating episodes of bipolar depression. The application of EMT with H1 coils can reach deepest regions of the brain and improve the clinical and cognitive condition of subjects with episodes of bipolar depression, and may be confirmed as a safe and virtually free of side effects.

The technique involves placement of a small coil over the scalp; passing a rapidly alternating current through the coil wire, which produces a magnetic field that passes unimpeded through the scalp and bone, resulting in electrical stimulation of the cortex.",Not Applicable,2014-06-25,2021-02-02,2020-12-01,Completed,"The presence of binge eating (BE) is a core feature of bulimic syndromes. Binge eating disorder (BED) is a new category in DSM-5 highly associated with higher body mass index (BMI). The neural mechanisms that underlie BE are of great interest in order to improve treatment interventions. Brain mechanisms underlying drug and food craving are suggested to be similar. These mechanisms demonstrated hyperactivity in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex and lack of regulatory influence from lateral prefrontal circuits. Several novel studies began to assess the potential benefits of brain stimulation in reducing craving and associated addictive behaviors with promising results. Previous findings testing a one-off session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in healthy women identified as strong cravers and individuals with bulimia nervosa or bulimic-type eating disorders reported reduction of food craving and BE, providing evidence to support a broader and deeper investigation of the benefits associated with rTMS. Importantly, the use of brain imaging studies contributes to the understanding of psychiatric disorders and underlying mechanisms being target by the rTMS intervention.||Objectives: The primary aim is to investigate the effects of rTMS over BE frequency. Secondary aims include the evaluation of the effects of rTMS on food craving, body weight, brain activity, cognition, general psychopathology, hormonal regulation and neurobiological markers. Methods: Sixty obese females with BED will be randomized to receive 20 sessions of rTMS (n=30) or placebo (n=30) scattered 3 days/week.||Expected Results: Primarily it is expected that rTMS intervention will decrease BE frequency.

Major depression bears a heavy burden for the individuals and family members afflicted, as well as an enormous health care and economic cost. Approximately half of major depressive patients seek out treatment for their illness and only 20% of those individuals report their treatment as satisfactory. Many MDD patients do not respond to pharmacological therapy following the first course of treatment, resulting in the need for alternative measures to alleviate the clinical and cognitive symptoms of treatment-resistant depression and the targeting of these therapies to better suit each individual patient. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-accepted, non-invasive technique that utilizes currents to induce electrical fields that excite specific brain regions. The current recommended practice of rTMS involves the administration of a biphasic stimulus waveform; however, a novel method using monophasic pulses may prove more effective for the treatment of depression.

Also, an even more important issue is the frequency of the sessions in each treatment protocol. The idea of performing stimulation in chronic pain patients on a consecutive daily basis for long-term treatments seem unrealistic and potentially costly. However, it has been reported in animals, healthy subjects and FM patients that the analgesic effects of rTMS can outlast the stimulation session for several minutes and even days. This has led to the proposal that pain treatment with rTMS could be performed in consecutive daily induction sessions, followed by spaced (weekly, fortnightly and even monthly) maintenance sessions. This approach is similar to what is performed routinely in patients with major depression treated by rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and has successfully been tested in FM patients in a single- center study. Should this approach prove effective in larger prospective multicentric studies, rTMS could enter the armamentarium of non-invasive, non- pharmacological, low-adverse event therapeutic options to relieve fibromyalgia- related pain and associate symptoms. Hence, our aim is to conduct a multicentric international clinical trial on the influence of rTMS in the control of pain in a consecutive adaptive trial design where conventional rTMS (10Hz) and patterned rTMS (theta-burst) will be studied. Stimulations will be performed in a clinical practice-friendly approach, where daily maintenance sessions will be followed by weekly, and fortnightly stimulation sessions. There have been very scarce adaptive trials in the pain and non-invasive stimulation fields. This methodological approach allows for the use of lower number of patients in consecutive trials and, among other qualities, it allows for the imputation of data from the first trial into the second one, thus decreasing the duration of the studies and the number of participants.",No,No,Fibromyalgia|Myofascial Pain Syndromes,Percentage of responders based on the reduction of ≥50% in pain intensity (numerical rating scale 0-10) at the end of the study compared to baseline.,Assess % of very much and much improved|Measured by VAS (0 no pain -10 worst pain)|Assess mood by hospital anxiety and depression scale|Measured by Brief Pain Inventory|Measured by brief pain inventory|Assess by fibromyalgia impact questionnaire|Assessment of phenotypical markers of analgesic response|Assess of adverse events by standardized questionnaire',80,Actual,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Female patients with diagnosis fibromyalgia according to the ACR 2016 criteria (patient satisfies modified 2016 fibromyalgia criteria if the following 3 conditions are met: 1) widespread pain index (WPI) ≥ 7 and symptom severity scale (SSS) score 5 OR WPI of 4-6 and SSS score ≥ 9. 2) Generalized pain, defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions, must be present.

Body weight and shape dissatisfaction is linked to the development, maintenance and relapse of AN. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the inferior parietal cortex is involved in body image perception and less activated in patients with AN compared with healthy subjects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to modulate cortical excitability, and particularly to increase excitability with high-frequency rTMS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ""excitatory"" high-frequency rTMS over the ""hypoactive"" inferior parietal cortex of 54 patients with AN.||This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will compare effective rTMS (2000 ten-Hz stimulations per session, applied at 90% of the resting motor threshold, with 10 sessions in two weeks) versus placebo rTMS.||Assessments will be performed before rTMS and after the last rTMS session (immediately after, at 15 days and three months). The principal criteria for judgement is a body image satisfaction scale (Boby Shape Questionnaire, BSQ-34). The secondary criteria for judgement are eating behaviour scales (Eating Attitude Test, EAT-40; Bulimia test, BULIT and Eating Disorders Inventory, EDI-2), the Hamilton depression rating scale and Hamilton anxiety rating scale, a quality of life scale (Short-Form Health Survey, SF-36), a body composition analysis using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the alpha-MSH autoantibodies levels (biomarker for eating disorders recently described).||Inferior parietal cortex rTMS could not only improve body image perception, but also help in the treatment of eating disorders, allowing weight gain with a decreased anxiety and improving patients' quality of life.

Bipolar depression (BPAD-DP) is associated with a twenty fold increased risk of suicide, and typically lasts three to five times as long as a manic or hypomanic episode. Despite this, there has been relatively sparse investigation of treatments for BPAD-DP, with guidelines based primarily on expert judgment rather than clinical trials. In addition a significant proportion of patients with bipolar depression do not respond to the range of commonly used medications. One of the only substantially new treatments developed for unipolar depression in recent years has been the advent of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Repetitive TMS has been evaluated in over 20 trials conducted over the last ten years, but no substantive trials have explored its use in bipolar depression. We propose to do this, conducting a large scale clinical trial. The trial will include the assessment of both high frequency left sided rTMS (as there is clearly the greatest evidence for the effectiveness of this in unipolar depression) and low frequency right sided rTMS (as this there is growing evidence of the effectiveness of this in unipolar depression and we have an excellent pilot study to suggest its potential in BPAD-DP and it has never previously been assessed in a clinical trial exclusively targeting this patient group). Our previous research strongly supports the effectiveness of rTMS paradigms including low frequency right-sided stimulation in unipolar depression and suggests these may have value in BPAD-DP.

However, the increasing number of patients accessing treatment for depression in clinical services is also likely to be accompanied by a sizeable increase in the number of patients with TRD. Despite the demand, relatively few treatment options are available to such patients. One of the only substantially new treatments developed for TRD in recent years has been the advent of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Repetitive TMS has been evaluated in over 20 trials conducted over the last 10 years. Previous research indicates that rTMS has antidepressant activity; however, the proportion of patients who respond to rTMS and the degree of treatment response demonstrated in trials to date is limited. The limitations of these studies include relatively small samples and limited duration of treatment (i.e., 2 weeks) as well as a lack of long term follow-up. As rTMS is gradually entering use in routine clinical practice (for example, recent regulation of its use in Canada), research is urgently required to establish ways to enhance treatment response both in regards to the extent of response within individuals and the proportion of individuals in whom rTMS has effects.||Stimulation site is another important treatment factor; thus far almost all of the trials of rTMS in TRD conducted have evaluated the utility of high frequency left prefrontal cortex (PFC) rTMS (HFL-TMS). In addition, several studies have evaluated the treatment efficacy of low frequency rTMS to right PFC (LFR-TMS). In a previously published study we have demonstrated that these two approaches have similar therapeutic benefit and both were superior to sham stimulation.||A promising new approach to enhance efficacy involves combining LFR-TMS and HFL-TMS in a sequential manner. We describe this as sequential bilateral rTMS (SB-rTMS). We have recently published the results of the first substantial evaluation of SB-rTMS showing not only a superiority to placebo in TRD but also a therapeutic response that is substantially superior to response rates in most of the published studies of unilateral rTMS (>50% of patients achieving standard criteria for clinical response compared to usually <30% in most studies). In this proposed research study, we will directly test the hypothesis that SB-rTMS produces a greater therapeutic response than HFL-TMS and compare both of these forms of stimulation to placebo (i.e., sham) stimulation.",,,"Depressive Disorder|Depressive Disorder, Major",,,67,Actual,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Patients will be included if they:||Have a DSM-IV diagnosis of a major depressive episode (SCID 11).|Aged 18-85.|Have treatment resistant depression at Stage II of the Thase and Rush classification [31]; .e. have failed to achieve a clinical response, or did not tolerate, at least two separate antidepressant trials of sufficient dose for at least 6 weeks.|Have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score of > 20 (moderate - severe depression).

In this proposal, we characterize motor and prefrontal network dysfunction in PSP and CBGD patients, and propose that high-frequency and low-frequency rTMS directed over separate motor and prefrontal cortical targets of each network may show specific and selective beneficial effects on motor vs. cognitive function in PSP and CBGD patients, respectively.

Therefore, avenues to optimize behavioral treatments are needed. Despite important advancements, neuroscience has had a limited effect on psychotherapy development. Therefore, one paradigm shift would be to develop neuroscience informed behavioral treatments.||The investigators identified from the literature a problem that affects several mental disorders (emotion dysregulation) and a neural circuit that underlies this important concern. They found that this circuit is dysfunctional in those with psychopathology but can be changed with treatment. The goal is in one session to train this brain network to operate more efficiently and to test the short and long term effects of this intervention. The investigators plan to engage this brain network using a traditional psychotherapy strategy (cognitive restructuring) and to enhance learning using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a neuromodulation technique through which magnetic stimulation enhances the electrical activity in brain areas close to the scalp.||The study team proposed two studies to examine this novel approach, In one of the studies 83 participants were enrolled and 47 eligible participants were divided into 3 groups. All participants were trained in emotion regulation by first being asked to remember an event where they experienced a negative emotion and then being instructed either to think differently about the event, or to wait. Participants simultaneously underwent either active (left or right side of brain) or sham rTMS. In a second study 65 participants were enrolled, and 31 were assigned to either active left or sham rTMS guided using neuroimaging results. Across both studies, the investigators measured regulation in the lab and during a-week long naturalistic assessment. Participants in the second study returned for a follow up neuroimaging visit at the end of this week. Participants returned for a one moth follow up assessment and to rate feasibility, acceptability, and provide feedback.

Psychophysiological measurements were collected continuously using the BIOPAC MP-150. For each baseline, heart rate (HR) was averaged from the last 240s. Time to return to one's HR baseline was defined as the amount of time (e.g., number of seconds) it took from the beginning of regulation for the continuously monitored HR to reach a value that was lower than the average pre-stimulus baseline HR. Lower numbers indicate quicker regulation (desirable outcome). A baseline value for regulation duration was computed as the time it took during habituation for the person to return to HR baseline. Number of seconds was transformed with a logarithmic function for analyses to achieve normality.|The investigators will examine difference in length of time that it takes participants to reduce emotional arousal (as measured with physiological indicators) after an emotional induction when they use CR. This measure, was collected at the 1 month follow up assessment. Only one stressor-regulation period was presented at follow up. The number of seconds it took for participants to return to the pre-stimulus baseline during the regulation period was transformed with a log function for normality. Lower numbers indicate quicker regulation, a desirable outcome.|The investigators will record heart rate continuously throughout the intervention and then extract high frequency heart rate variability (an index of emotion regulation) from the regulation periods. Continuously recorded HR was divided into 120 s bins, and HF-HRV was extracted from cleaned raw ECG from each bin. Baseline HF-HRV was measured at the beginning of the experiment and right before each autobiographical stressor presentation. The treatment condition (active left, active right, or sham), baselines, the experimental condition (regulation 1, 2, and 3), and the time within each experimental condition (0 to 4 for each 120 s segment within that period) were used to predict HF-HRV. Higher HF-HRV indicates enhanced regulation, a desirable outcome. To make interpretation easier, the raw HF-HRV score was multiplied with 1000000. To achieve normality, this multiplied score was transformed with a logarithmic function.|For groups 4 &5, the investigators collected functional imaging data while participants engaged in an emotion regulation task. We examined the BOLD response change in the contrast between down-regulating negative emotions and feeling negative emotions a week after intervention controlling for the maximum change in this contrast at intake. Specifically we examined changes in activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), the amygdala and insula. Data were first preprocessed with fMRIprep and MRIQC. At the first level, functional data were analyzed as individual runs, using a general linear model (GLM) in which trial events were convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. The [Restructure- Feel_negative] contrast was then used to generate Level 2 analysis, in which BOLD activity for each of the four runs were combined using a fixed-effect model.

Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). We computed the total score (ranging from 0 to 180) from data collected at intake, at 1 week after the intervention, and at 1 month after the intervention.

Due to economic realities on most stroke units, SLT can often not be given with optimal intensity in the first weeks after the stroke. Developing new adjuvant therapies which may render SLT sessions more effective is thus one approach to improve rehabilitation outcome. Recent functional imaging studies in post-stroke aphasia have shown that the recruitment of brain regions in the unaffected hemisphere seems to be an inferior strategy for recovery of language function as compared to re-activation of brain regions in the vicinity of the infarct. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are new methods to modulate brain activity. Evidence from our own feasibility study in sub-acute stroke suggests that these new techniques, when applied in conjunction with conventional SLT, may help to normalize brain activation patterns and might yield better rehabilitation outcome than SLT alone.

(Aim 2) The investigators further hypothesize that improvement in Tourette syndrome symptoms will be moderated by low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced changes in GABA and glutamate in the supplementary motor area, and changes in the functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex. Eleven children (7-12 years of age) with Tourette syndrome will be undergo low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (five times a week for three weeks).

Studies have generally shown standard HF-TMS to be effective in treating major depressive disorder (MDD), although treatment effects are often highly variable and there are several negative trials in the specialized literature. One reason for these discrepant results might be that standard HF-TMS only enables direct stimulation of superficial brain areas and, consequently, it is possible that the stimulation of deeper and more widespread brain regions could produce superior and more reliable results. Recently, a novel form of HF-rTMS (called deep transcranial magnetic stimulation or DTMS), that allows direct stimulation of much larger and deeper brain regions, has also been shown to be effective and safe in treating MDD. Neuroimaging studies have shown that standard HF-rTMS directly affects several superficial areas of the brain, but to date there is no data on the brain effects of DTMS. Thus, this study aims to explore, for the first time, the brain effects of DTMS in MDD. More specifically, we, the investigators, hope to identify possible neural predictors of clinical improvement after DTMS and also clarify the impact of DTMS in the brain activity over time. In this study, DTMS will be applied over the left side of the front of the head (a region known as the 'prefrontal cortex'), and will be compared with standard HF-TMS in terms of its effectiveness and brain effects. For this, subjects with at least moderate MDD will be randomized to receive daily DTMS or standard HF-rTMS treatment for 4 weeks, and will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment. fMRI is a neuroimaging technique that allows us to measure which areas of the brain are more or less 'active' in response to specific stimuli at a particular time. During the fMRI sessions, we will use a validated cognitive task on working memory. Our results could eventually lead us, among other things, to identify which depressed patients would be best candidates for receiving either standard HF-rTMS or DTMS, and which areas of the brain should be targeted by these neuromodulation techniques.",,,"Depression|Depressive Disorder|Depressive Disorder, Major",Pre-post neuromodulation changes on HAM-D21 scores,Response to treatment is defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the scores of the HAM-D21.

The inability to quit despite motivation to do so, is thought to result in part, from self-control failure. Working memory (WM) deficits contribute to imbalanced self-control and allow automatic impulses to drive behavior. Thus, WM plays a critical role in addictive behavior, and is particularly relevant to smoking. Indeed, a strong link between WM and smoking has been established in the literature; most notably, degree of WM impairment and deficits in activation in associated brain regions predict time to relapse, and WM moderates the relationship between craving and relapse. Given these insights, researchers have been examining interventions that may target WM including WM training (WMT) and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). WMT involves taxing this executive function repeatedly over time and has shown positive preliminary results in improving measures of self-control and reducing consumption of addictive substances. Similarly, rTMS, a non-invasive brain stimulation procedure that stimulates neuronal tissues and increases cortical excitability, has been shown to increase WM capacity and reduce craving and consumption of several addictive substances including nicotine. While these interventions have demonstrated initial promise in affecting addictive behaviors, the magnitude and durability of their effects may be limited. Recently, researchers have posited - but not yet empirically tested - that WMT administered in combination with rTMS may result in an additive or supra-additive effect in treating addictive processes. This is highly significant; the clinical utility of rTMS over current first line treatments may be limited if factors with potential to enhance its effectiveness are not examined. Given these recent advances in the literature, the primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the individual and combined effects of Working Memory (WM) training and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on WM performance and smoking behaviors as well as critical mediators of these effects. These aims will be examined in a sample of tobacco dependent adults (N=130) utilizing a 2x2 factorial experimental design including four groups (WMT+rTMS, sham WMT+rTMS, WMT+sham TMS, and sham WMT+sham rTMS) capable of isolating independent and combined effects of WMT and rTMS.",Yes,No,Tobacco Use Disorder,"The Delay to Smoking Analogue Task is a behavioral choice paradigm that is sensitive to smoking medication effects in which participants earn monetary rewards for delaying initiation of cigarette smoking in 5-minute increments over a 50-minute period, following 3-hours of observed smoking deprivation.

It has been shown to be a safe procedure . Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation coils are designed to maximize the electrical field deep in the brain by the summation of separate fields projected into the skull from several points around its periphery. The device is planned to minimize the accumulation of electrical charge on the surface of the brain. Such accumulation can give rise to an electrostatic field that might reduce the magnitude of the induced electric field both at the surface and inside, thus reducing the depth penetration of the induced electric field . Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation could be more effective than repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation due to its deeper penetration into brain tissues . The deeper penetration should produce greater action on nerve fibers connecting the prefrontal cortex to the limbic system.||The ability of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to alter dopaminergic neurotransmission in subcortical structures could explain recent reports, which suggest that it has the potential to reduce smoking and nicotine craving. Ecihhammer et al demonstrated a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked and in the desire to smoke after a single rTMS treatment (Eichhammer et al., 2003). In addition, Johan et al in a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated a reduction in cigarette consumption and desire to smoke after a single repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment (Johann et al., 2003). Recently, the investigators have finished a complete study on nicotine addiction using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for 10 consecutive days. They have found that 10 days of rTMS reduced significantly better from placebo the number of cigarettes smoked, nicotine dependence and craving (Amiaz et al 2007, in preparation). Interestingly, some of the effects were stronger in the sub-group of patients that were presented with smoking-related pictures immediately prior to stimulation onset. Although, these results are interesting and exciting, they have two important caveats. First, only about 50%-60% of the smokers responded to the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment. Second, among those responded to the treatment, only 10% had quit totally from smoking. Therefore, the potential therapeutic benefit of this treatment is limited. The investigators' hypothesis is that deep transcranial magnetic stimulation may be more efficient in smoking cessation due to it's deeper penetration and therefore it's capability to stimulate deeper fibers of the dopamine-reward-activating system.",,,"Lung Diseases|Lung Diseases, Obstructive|Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",,,115,Actual,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:||Male or female patients, Aged 21-70 years.|Subjects who smoke >20 cigarettes per day.|Subjects are diagnosed as suffering from COPD|Patients who are motivated to quit smoking.||Patients who failed to respond to all 3 of the following anti-smoking treatments:||po Bupropion (Zyban/Wellbutrin) or Varenicline (Champix)|Nicotine patch/ nicotine gum|CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy)||Exclusion Criteria:||History of a primary major psychiatric or cognitive disorder according to DSM IV.|Current alcohol or other substance abuse or dependence.|Alcohol or other substance abuse or dependence during the last 12 months before recruitment.|History of or evidence of significant brain malformation or neoplasm, head injury, cerebral vascular events, neurodegenerative disorder affecting the brain or prior brain surgery.|No neurological co-morbidity.|No psychiatric co-morbidity.|No psychotropic medications.|Severe somatic co morbidity.|Cardiac pace makers, other electronic implants, intracranial metallic particles.|History of seizures or epileptiform activity.|Pregnancy and lactation.|Patients who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator or who are not likely to cope with the requirements of the experiment.|Patients unwilling or unable to give written informed consent.|Patients with a high risk for severe violence or suicidality as assessed during the screening interview.|Participation in a clinical trial within the last 30 days before the beginning of this clinical trial or similar participation in another clinical trial.",,No,25038985,Beer-Yaacov,Israel,,,,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00951782"", ""NCT00951782"")"

MDD affects approximately 15% of adolescents; it is associated with impairment in social, family, and academic functioning, and it is a major risk factor for suicide - a leading cause of death in adolescents . Unfortunately, there is a paucity of treatment options for this age group. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the only class of medications approved for treating MDD in adolescents, but rates of remission following treatment with SSRIs are only 30 to 45 percent. Cognitive behavior therapy is associated with similar remission rates and access is limited. Most adolescents will require more than one therapeutic intervention in order to achieve full symptom control. Collectively, there is overwhelming evidence that additional treatment options are urgently needed to improve outcomes for teens with MDD. One novel treatment for adolescent MDD is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Studies in children have been limited (a total of 23 cases). This is surprising given the evidence suggesting younger adult subjects with MDD respond better to rTMS (56% response rate) than older subjects. This limited experience with rTMS for adolescent MDD represents a substantial gap in the knowledge, recently recognized in publications calling for further study of rTMS in adolescent depression. Most importantly, the mechanism of action of rTMS in adolescent MDD is not well understood. The objective of this application is to develop an understanding of the brain alterations associated with the positive clinical changes that occur with rTMS in adolescent MDD. Such knowledge will provide the basis for pursuing rTMS for adolescent MDD as a rational therapeutic technique.||Specific Aim: To compare the effect of rTMS on DLPFC glutamate concentration in adolescent MDD. The investigators hypothesize an increase (normalization to controls) in DLPFC glutamate after three weeks of rTMS.

Smoking cessation is difficult, with the average smoker attempting to quit five times before permanent success. Moreover, the majority of smoking quit attempts result in relapse. Brain stimulation for smoke cessation is an exciting new area that builds on advancing neuroscience knowledge concerning the functional neurocircuitry of addiction. Cortical stimulation can now be performed non-invasively by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Several studies have shown that TMS can reduce cue-elicited craving in smokers. Previous research by group has shown that a single session of 15 minutes high frequency (10 Hz) repetitive TMS (rTMS) at 100% motor threshold over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can reduce cue-induced craving compared to sham TMS. However, the mechanism by which craving is reduced by rTMS is poorly understood both at behavioral and neural levels. Neuroimaging studies in nicotine dependence have revealed cue-related responses in numerous brain areas, including frontal, parietal cortices and subcortical areas. Recently functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies by the group have shown that cue-induced craving induced brain activation in ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), including medial frontal, orbital frontal and anterior cingulate. This Chair Research Development Fund (CRDF) pilot proposal will integrate two new techniques- TMS and fMRI to investigate DLPFC-VMPFC pathway in smokers. Using double-masked methods investigators hypothesize that cue-induced exposure will induce brain activity in VMPFC, and 15 minutes rTMS over DLPFC will reduce cue-induced craving through modulating DLPFC-VMPFC pathway (increased activity DLPFC and decreased activity VMPFC).",,,Tobacco Use Disorder,"During MRI scan in which participants will watch smoking picture, investigators will measure the change in neural activity in reward neural circuit.

Patients with vestibular disorders frequently have disabling disturbances of perception. Related to these symptoms is that large areas of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum receive information from the vestibular, visual and somatosensory systems that is integrated within a vestibular cortical network into an accurate perception of spatial orientation. Interrupting the pathways that process information about the direction of gravity and angular velocity leads to impairment of the internal estimate of gravity and the perception of body motion. The strategy of this research is to use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to produce transient focal lesions that allow study of acute loss of function within the central vestibular pathways at the very beginning of adaptation. Our underlying hypothesis is that the immediate effects of a lesion in the cerebellum will be to affect ocular motor control of vestibular reflexes and perception alike but with a cortical lesion there will be dissociation between ocular motor control and perception.

However, despite the advances in neuroscience over the past 20 years, chronic pain is still largely treated with opiate narcotics, much as was done in the Civil War. In addition to the high abuse liability and dependence potential, only 30-40% of chronic pain patients declare they receive satisfactory (>50%) relief from their pain through pharmacological treatment. In these patients a common clinical practice is to escalate the dose of opiates as tolerance develops - which unfortunately has contributed to escalation in opiate overdose deaths, a resurgence of intravenous heroin use, and $55 billion in societal costs.

However, despite the advances in neuroscience over the past 20 years, chronic pain is largely treated with opiate narcotics, much as was done in the Civil War. In addition to their high abuse liability and dependence potential, only 30 40% of chronic pain patients declare they receive satisfactory (>50%) relief from their pain through pharmacological treatment. In these patients a common clinical practice is to escalate the dose of opiates as tolerance develops which unfortunately has contributed to escalation in opiate overdose deaths, a resurgence of intravenous heroin use, and $55 billion in societal costs. Consequently, there is a critical need for new treatments that can treat pain and reduce reliance on opiates in individuals with chronic pain.||The proposed study will be the first to employ a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design to parametrically evaluate the longitudinal effects of 16 days of Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the primary motor cortex (MC) or the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) on self-reported pain and the brain s response to pain.

As locomotor regions degenerate in PD, gait automaticity is impaired. Patients compensate by increasing volitional control of gait, however, this adaptation has been found to worsen FoG severity. We hypothesize that increased cortical control of gait is maladaptive, and therapies to improve gait automaticity will not be effective unless cortical control of gait is reduced. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a therapeutic approach for FoG that simultaneously reduces cortical control and increases automaticity of gait. The objective is to determine the locomotor network abnormalities responsible for FoG and demonstrate how neuromodulation and rehabilitation can modulate the network. The rationale of this study is that increased connectivity between brainstem locomotor regions and cortical structures represents increased cortical governance of gait, and it can be reversed by the proposed intervention. We will accomplish this by combining a course of inhibitory rTMS (1Hz) to the cortex (supplementary motor area) with a rehabilitation protocol designed to increase gait automaticity (dual task training). We have designed a study that will carefully assess the locomotor network of freezers with resting state functional, diffusion and interleaved TMS/BOLD MRI studies, before and after intervention. Behavioral measures including gait analysis, cognitive and motor assessments will also be conducted at baseline and post treatment. The study aims to determine the effects of our intervention on the locomotor network (assessed with imaging), as well as on FoG severity as quantified through multiple markers obtained through gait analysis. At the conclusion of the study we expect to have determined the network changes central to the pathophysiology of FoG, the effects of 1Hz rTMS + rehabilitation on this network, and on FoG severity.||The relevance of this study to public health is to develop a non-invasive effective therapeutic option for one of the most debilitating and untreatable conditions affecting the lives of one million Americans suffering from PD; freezing of gait.",No,Yes,Parkinson Disease,Change (pre vs post intervention) in resting-state fMRI connectivity (fisher z-score) of the supplemental motor area (SMA).

Those enrolled may participate in all parts or in part 1 or part 2. Those who choose to participate in part 3 must first complete part 2. All must stop taking medication for TS and any other medication that may affect the brain for at least 1 week before the study.||Part 1||After numbing the skin or muscles of the arm or leg where a pre-tic sensation is experienced, the response of the nerves will be tested by asking subjects to rate the strength of the sensation after a pinprick and by stimulating the nerves with small electrical shocks. Then, over the course of approximately one hour, subjects will report pre-tic sensations while their motor tics are counted. The onset of each tic will be identified with EMG, a test using electrodes on the skin to indicate the activity of the muscles.||Part 2||Subjects brain waves are recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they are experiencing tics andpre-tic sensory experiences. MEG is a test that records magnetic field changes produced by brain activity. Subjects sit in a chair under a dome containing magnetic field detectors. They watch a clock and report the time a sensory experience starts. Tics are recorded with EMG. Later, a standard MRI of the brain (scan using a magnetic field and radio waves) is done to see which parts of the brain produced the activity recorded with MEG.||Part 3||Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to try to stop the pre-tic sensations. For TMS, the subject sits in a chair. A wire coil is held on the subject s scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates a region of the brain. The goal of this stimulation is to reduce the sensory experience that precedes a tic in one region of the body. During stimulation, the subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. This study uses a pattern of repeated pulses delivered in short bursts. Following each train of pulses, the effect of the stimulation on sensation will be tested by asking the subject to rate the strength of a pinprick and of a vibration. In addition, the nerves are stimulated with small shocks to evaluate the effect of the TMS on nerve activity. To determine the effect of TMS on the pre-tic sensation, subjects are asked to watch a clock and report when they are having a sensory experience.

The ability to tell the difference between sensory signals is important to understanding sensory input. Understanding how this works may help to develop new treatments for sensory deficits.||Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures during three visits to the NIH Clinical Center:||rTMS - all visits (sham rTMS on one visit) :||For TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current passed through the coil creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.||Theta burst stimulation (TBS) - all visits (sham TBS on one visit):||Same as TMS, but brief pulses of electrical current are passed through the coil. Subjects undergo intermittent TBS on one visit and continuous TBS on another.||Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) - all visits:||SEP tests how sensory information travels along the nerves to the spinal cord and brain. A small metal disk electrode placed on an arm delivers a small electrical shock. Electrodes placed on the scalp record how the impulse travels over the nerve pathways to the cerebral cortex of the brain. EEG (see below) records what sensory information the brain is detecting and processing. Paired-pulse SEP is done before and after TBS.||Temporal discrimination threshold - all visits:||This test investigates the brain's ability to discriminate sensory information. Electrodes are placed on the subject's wrist. Two electrical pulses are delivered to the nerve at the wrist at different spaced intervals to determine when the subject feels the two pulses are fused into one. This test is done before and after TBS.||Electroencephalography (EEG) - all visits:||This test records brain waves (electrical activity of the brain).

In TMS, a wire coil is held on the patient's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. Carbidopa-levodopa is a medication usually used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it may improve the effect of theta burst stimulation.||Two kinds of TMS are used in this study. In single-pulse TMS one or two pulses are delivered at a time in order to measure brain activity at that moment. In repetitive TMS (rTMS), a series of pulses are given in short bursts, temporarily altering brain activity. The type of rTMS used in this study is called theta burst stimulation.||Healthy normal volunteers and people who had a stroke 6 months or more before entering the study may be eligible to participate. All candidates must be between 18 and 90 years of age.

Normal volunteers must be right-handed.||Participants complete the testing for this study in four main sessions scheduled at least a week apart and five short follow-up sessions. At each main session, participants take either a carbidopa-levodopa tablet or a placebo (a look-alike inactive substance). Stroke patients have their arm and hand function assessed using two tests. One requires them to insert pegs into holes; the other includes writing, lifting various objects, and performing activities like turning pages, feeding or stacking checkers.||All subjects complete a questionnaire regarding their mood and alertness and then perform tests of thumb or wrist movement. For this test, a small electrical stimulus is applied to the side of the hand and the subject must respond to the stimulus as quickly as possible by making a thumb or wrist movement. This is repeated several times over about 3 minutes. A second test follows in which the subject moves the thumb or wrist in response to a beep from a speaker. This test is repeated several times over about 8 minutes. Some measurements are taken using single-pulse TMS during the beginning, middle and end of this test. In two of the four sessions, theta burst stimulation is applied after the single-pulse TMS and in the other two sessions, sham theta burst stimulation is applied.||Five follow-up sessions are scheduled one day after each main session and one week following the final one.

Specifically, anodal tDCS applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with improvement of cognitive functions and mood. Despite an increased use in clinical settings, tDCS suffers from limitations, especially regarding the strength and the duration of therapeutic effects. Strategies to optimize the conditions for tDCS application suffer from the lack of knowledge about its neurophysiological impact. Moreover, tDCS is increasingly used in private settings through commercial apparatus and tutorials to make a ""do-it-yourself"" device delivering tDCS now available on the Internet. This private use worries neuroscientists and health authorities. Even if the general impression is that, in controlled conditions, tDCS is safe with only mild and transient adverse effects, whether and how tDCS could be used for enhancing cognition in healthy subjects are needed to investigate in more detail. The investigators believe that a better understanding of some neurobiological effects of tDCS is crucial to further tailor tDCS for experimental and therapeutic applications and to define recommendations for a private use.||As the cortex is densely connected with basal ganglia areas, including dopaminergic areas, tDCS is probably not only capable to target cortical but also subcortical structures remote from the stimulation sites.

Specifically, fronto-temporal tDCS, with anodal stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathodal stimulation over the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), has been reported to reduce treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations (AH), negative symptoms and insight of the illness in schizophrenia. However, despite an increasing use in clinical settings, tDCS suffers from limitations, especially regarding the strength and the duration of therapeutic effects.||Some imaging reports suggest that tDCS effects are not restricted to the brain areas located under the electrodes, but spread through distributed cortical networks functionally connected with the targets and reach subcortical areas. Overall, these studies suggest that tDCS modulates functional connectivity within and across resting-state networks and brain activity. However, these effects are currently described at different levels depending on the imaging technique used. Moreover, the majority of studies have focused on motor cortex stimulation, while the specific effects of fronto-temporal tDCS are scarce. Finally, effects of the stimulation applied online are rarely inspected.||According to the therapeutic effects of fronto-temporal tDCS on schizophrenia and the dopaminergic pathophysiological hypothesis of schizophrenia, the effect of fronto-temporal tDCS on dopaminergic transmission is of major interest. As the cortex is densely connected with basal ganglia areas, tDCS effects are probably capable to reach subcortical dopaminergic areas. Indeed, recent fMRI studies highlighted subcortical effects of tDCS applied at the cortical level including modulations of cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. In addition, some studies suggest that cortical stimulation by other approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates dopaminergic transmission. However, tDCS effects on dopaminergic transmission have been investigated only indirectly.||Finally, information about biological effects of tDCS is scattered and creating a coherent ensemble is a mandatory and critical step to understand the mechanisms of action of tDCS.||According to the hypothesis that fronto-temporal tDCS modulates brain activity, connectivity and dopaminergic transmission, the aim of this project is to reveal the combined neurobiological impact of an online single session of fronto-temporal tDCS in a unique experiment by developing a simultaneous multimodal imaging approach (PET-MRI). The online implementation of the stimulation will allow deciphering changes induced during and after stimulation. As a first step before investigating patients with schizophrenia, healthy subjects will be involved in the present study.||The distributed changes will be explored at rest through:||Spontaneous functional connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI).|Brain activity assessed by cerebral blood flow quantitatively and directly measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL).|Connectivity assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).|Specific and localized dopaminergic transmission evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) using dopaminergic D2 subtype receptor availability via [11C]raclopride binding.||The pioneering aspects of the project are to use an innovative simultaneous multimodal imaging system, adopt the tDCS montage used in our validated therapeutic context and apply tDCS online. We expect that our unique approach will provide an imaging biomarker essential to improve our understanding of:||the ""normal brain"" and further deficient mechanisms underlying schizophrenia as well as neurological disorders.||neurobiological effects of tDCS in order to:||Bring key element of the proof of concept of tDCS|Optimize tDCS in a therapeutic context|Suggest a marker of the therapeutic response",No,No,,Measure of the Binding Ratio of the radiomarker defined as the ratio of : region of interest / cerebellum activities,The impact of tDCS will be analysed using functional connectivity maps seeded from stimulated regions and from areas belonging to specific networks.

The organization of health care delivery contributes significantly to these disparities. For rural residents with multiple chronic conditions, transitioning along the continuum of care, between systems of treatment and support, and between dispersed locations present significant challenges. One critical challenge involves hospitalization for treatment because it requires travel to locations at a significant distance from home and disrupts personal and family routines. The transition back home is also problematic because discharge planning does not adequately account for limited access to care in rural areas. Indeed, discharge planning has been recently described as a ""black hole;"" fragmented and uncoordinated, and contributing to poor outcomes and patient dissatisfaction.

The investigators have tested if MWR could be used for early diagnostics of pulmonary COVID-19 complications.||This was a randomized controlled trial (195 subjects) to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics using MWR in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 while they are in hospitals of Kyrgyzstan, and healthy individuals.||The investigator have measured skin (IR) and internal (MWR) temperature by recording passive electromagnetic radiation through the chest wall in the projection of the lungs at 30 symmetrical points on both sides. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by X-RAY/CT scan and doctor's final diagnosis (pn+/pn-). COVID-19 was determined by PCR test (covid+/covid-).||Overall, the study suggests that the use of MWR is a convenient and safe method for screening diagnostics in COVID-19 patients with suspected pneumonia.

OCD is a persistent and oftentimes disabling disorder marked by unwanted and distressing thoughts (obsessions) and irresistible repetitive behaviors. OCD affects 2-3% of the US population, and is responsible for substantial functional impairment and increased risk of early death.||The only established first-line treatments for OCD are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention and certain medications. About 30-40% of patients fail to respond and few experience complete symptom resolution. Up to 25% of patients have difficulty tolerating CBT and the risk of relapse after therapies remains large. For the most severe cases, neurosurgery (surgery in the brain), has long been the option of last resort.||In this study the investigators want develop an adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) system to use in subjects with intractable (hard to control) OCD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains investigational for OCD patients and is not considered standard therapy. DBS involves the surgical implantation of leads and electrodes into specific areas of the brain, which are thought to influence the disease. A pack implanted in the chest, called the neurotransmitter, keeps the electrical current coursing to the brain through a wire that connects the neurotransmitter and electrodes. It is believed DBS may restore balance to dysfunctional brain circuitry implicated in OCD.
